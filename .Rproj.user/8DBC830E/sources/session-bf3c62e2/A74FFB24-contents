**The R Workshop Book** is designed to help beginners learn R for data analysis, focusing on tabular data manipulation and visualization using the tidyverse. It serves as a companion to workshops originally developed and taught at the University of Utah, covering R fundamentals, data frames, and visualization with ggplot2.
