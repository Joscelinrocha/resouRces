## [The Evolution of a ggplot (Ep. 1)](https://cedricscherer.netlify.app/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/)

By [CÃ©dric](https://cedricscherer.netlify.app/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from the blog:** In this series of blog posts, I aim to show you how to turn a default ggplot into a plot that visualizes information in an appealing and easily understandable way.
The goal of each blog post is to provide a step-by-step tutorial explaining how my visualization have evolved from a typical basic ggplot.
All plots are going to be created with 100% {ggplot2} and 0% Inkscape.

## [Where are the 4+-Car Households?](https://haraldkliems.netlify.app/posts/2024-02-29-where-are-the-4-car-households/)

By Harald Kliems

**What is this?**

This article explores the distribution of households in the United States that own four or more vehicles.
Utilizing data from the American Community Survey, the author presents maps and analyses to identify regions with high concentrations of such households.
The study provides insights into transportation patterns, urban planning, and the socio-economic factors influencing vehicle ownership across different areas.
This is great for visualization examples (code is within the blog).
