Added Sat Dec, 2021.\
**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from site:** "This is a gentle introduction to the tidymodels package (which, like the tidyverse, is actually a collection of packages), and in order to examine various functions and capabilities of those packages, we'll build two very simple models, using easily available NHL data, and go over a few ways to evaluate them".

## [Learning R with Hockey Data and learnr](https://meghan.rbind.io/blog/learnr/) ðŸŒ±

By [Meghan Hall](https://meghan.rbind.io/blog/learnr/)

Added Sat Dec, 2021.\
**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from site:** "I've created two tutorials in learnr, one that is a true introduction for beginners (focused on the tidyverse) and one that goes a little bit deeper into data manipuation with pivoting and joining data. These tutorials (screenshot below) live in a package I created called betweenthepipes".
