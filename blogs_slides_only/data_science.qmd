## [How I Structure My RStudio Projects](https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/08/rstudio-project-structure/) üíØ

**What is this?**

In this article, David Keyes shares his standardized approach to organizing RStudio projects to enhance efficiency and collaboration.
He emphasizes the importance of a consistent file structure, detailing the use of specific folders such as `data-raw` for raw data, `data` for processed data, and `R` for functions.
By adopting this structure, Keyes reduces decision fatigue and streamlines project workflows, making it easier for both individual and collaborative work.

## [Using the tidyverse with Databases](https://sciencificity-blog.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-12-using-the-tidyverse-with-databases/)

By [Vebash Naidoo](https://sciencificity-blog.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-12-using-the-tidyverse-with-databases/)

**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from site:** You know R, especially the dplyr üì¶.
Even though the dplyr üì¶ is so well written to mimic the SQL syntax - select(), group_by(), left_join() etc. there is still a cognitive load when you switch between using R syntax, and SQL syntax (ask me, who has often written == in SQL syntax on Athena only to wonder why I am getting an error ü§ê).

You only have so much memory in your local environment, and may want your RDBMS to do the heavy lifting (most of the computation), and only pull data into R when you need to (e.g. pull in aggregated data to create plots for a report).

In this tutorial you will learn how to use dbplyr, which is a database back-end of dplyr, to execute queries directly in your RDBMS all the while writing R tidyverse syntax üòÆ ‚≠ê.
