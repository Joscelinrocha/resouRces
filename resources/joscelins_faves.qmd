-   ❇️ [grateful: Facilitate citation of R
    packages](https://pakillo.github.io/grateful/) 💯
    -   Added Mon Apr 24, 2023

The goal of **grateful** is to make it very easy to cite R and the R
packages used in any analyses, so that package authors receive their
deserved credit. By calling a single function, **grateful** will scan
the project for R packages used and generate a BibTeX file containing
all citations for those packages.

**grateful** can then generate a new document with citations in the
desired output format (Word, PDF, HTML, Markdown). These references can
be formatted for a specific journal, so that we can just paste them
directly into our manuscript or report.

-   ❇️ [widyr: Widen, process, and re-tidy a
    dataset](https://github.com/dgrtwo/widyr) 💯

This a package developed by David Robinson, Julia Siege and Kanishka
Misra that un-tidys the dataset into a wide matrix, performs some
processing, then re-tidys the dataset. This package wraps the pattern of
un-tidying data into a wide matrix, performing some processing, then
turning it back into a tidy form. This is useful for several
mathematical operations such as co-occurrence counts, correlations, or
clustering that are best done on a wide matrix. 1. Link to repo here:

-   [ggeasy](https://github.com/jonocarroll/ggeasy) 💯 This package
    makes using ggplot2 way much easier. Check it out.

-   ❇️ [DataEditR by Dillon
    Hammill](https://dillonhammill.github.io/DataEditR/)💯 **What is
    this?** Manual data entry and editing in R can be tedious,
    especially if you have limited coding experience and are accustomed
    to using software with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). DataEditR
    is an R package built on shiny and rhandsontable that makes it easy
    to interactively view, enter, filter and edit data. If you are new
    to DataEditR visit https://dillonhammill.github.io/DataEditR/ to get
    started.

-   ❇️ [The magick package: Advanced Image-Processing in
    R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html#Installing_magick):
    The new magick package is an ambitious effort to modernize and
    simplify high-quality image processing in R. It wraps the
    ImageMagick STL which is perhaps the most comprehensive open-source
    image processing library available today.

-   ❇️ **See slides as tiles!:** if you use xaringan: install
    {xaringanExtra} and add this chunk to the beginning of your slides
    to get this nifty tile overview! (press "o" to see it:
    xaringanExtra::use)\_xaringan_extra(c("title_view")

-   ❇️
    [traceback](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/traceback):
    By default traceback() prints the call stack of the last uncaught
    error, i.e., the sequence of calls that lead to the error. This is
    useful when an error occurs with an unidentifiable error message. It
    can also be used to print the current stack or arbitrary lists of
    deparsed calls.

-   ❇️
    [debug](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/debug.html):
    Set, unset or query the debugging flag on a function. The text and
    condition arguments are the same as those that can be supplied via a
    call to browser. They can be retrieved by the user once the browser
    has been entered, and provide a mechanism to allow users to identify
    which breakpoint has been activated.

-   ❇️ [tmap](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap): visualizing
    spatiotemporal data. This package allows you to create thematic
    maps.

-   ❇️ [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/): The arrow package,
    created by Ursa Labs allows for the fast loading and processing of
    large data.

-   ❇️ [funneljoin](https://github.com/robinsones/funneljoin): allows
    you to do time-based joins to analyze a sequence of events. With
    this package you can analyze behavior funnels.

-   ❇️ [fable](https://github.com/tidyverts/fable): Fable provides a
    collection of time series forecasting models. According to the
    fables READ.me on Github, these models work within the fable
    framework, which provides the tools to evaluate, visualize, and
    combine models in a workflow consistent with the tidyverse.

    [parameters](https://easystats.github.io/parameters/index.html)💯:
    parameters' primary goal is to provide utilities for processing the
    parameters of various statistical models (see here for a list of
    supported models). Beyond computing p-values, CIs, Bayesian indices
    and other measures for a wide variety of models, this package
    implements features like bootstrapping of parameters and models,
    feature reduction (feature extraction and variable selection), or
    tools for data reduction like functions to perform cluster, factor
    or principal component analysis.
    -   Another important goal of the parameters package is to
        facilitate and streamline the process of reporting results of
        statistical models, which includes the easy and intuitive
        calculation of standardized estimates or robust standard errors
        and p-values. parameters therefor offers a simple and unified
        syntax to process a large variety of (model) objects from many
        different packages.
