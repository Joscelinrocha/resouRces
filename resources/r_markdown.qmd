By [Meghan Hall](https://meghan.rbind.io/talk/rstudio/)

Added Sat Dec, 11, 2021

underutilized tool for a powerful yet underutilized

## [grateful: Facilitate citation of R packages](https://pakillo.github.io/grateful/) ðŸ’¯

By [Francisco Rodriguez-Sanchez & Connor P.
Jackson](https://pakillo.github.io/grateful/)

Added Mon Apr 24th, 2023

**What is it?**\
**Excerpt from package:** The goal of grateful is to make it
very easy to cite R and the R packages used in any analyses,
so that package authors receive their deserved credit. By
calling a single function, grateful will scan the project
for R packages used and generate a BibTeX file containing
all citations for those packages.

grateful can then generate a new document with citations in
the desired output format (Word, PDF, HTML, Markdown). These
references can be formatted for a specific journal, so that
we can just paste them directly into our manuscript or
report.

By [Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux, Emily

popular posts from Stack Overflow and other online resources
(such as blog posts or tutorials) to provide up-to-date

cover in this book, the second author of this book,

our cookbook can become more useful by including recipes
from these popular posts.
