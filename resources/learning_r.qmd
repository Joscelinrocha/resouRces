## [A gentle crash course in R using tidyverse](https://osf.io/69gub/) üå±

By: Nicholas M. Michalak & Loek Brinkman

**What is this?**

**Description from site:** In this three-hour workshop, we introduce you to data science in the R programming language. In particular, we'll show you how to use the "tidyverse" package to transform, visualize and model data. The workshop consists of short introductory presentations followed by elaborate hands-on sessions. At the end of each section, we'll showcase more complex features and functionality. The workshop is designed as an introduction to R. Zero programming experience is required. By the end of the workshop, you'll have a "feel" for what R is and what it can do for you, and we'll provide resources for follow-up self-study.

## [Just Enough R](https://benwhalley.github.io/just-enough-r/) üå±

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book here:** R makes it easy to work with and learn from data.

It also happens to be a programmming language, but if you're reading this, that might not be of interest. That's OK --- the goal here is not to teach programming1. The goal is to teach you just enough R to be confident to explore your data.

This book uses R like any other statistics software: To work-with and visualize data, run statistical analyses, and share our results with others. To do that you don't need more than the absolute basics of the R language itself.

The emphasis is on rapidly getting to be able to use R for most of the common practical purposes, and knowing that you can take it further should you need to. It is designed for you to be able to work through on your own.

## [Programming with R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)

By [The Carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This lesson is written as an introduction to R, but its real purpose is to introduce the single most important idea in programming: how to solve problems by building functions, each of which can fit in a programmer's working memory. In order to teach that, we must teach people a little about the mechanics of manipulating data with lists and file I/O so that their functions can do things they actually care about. Our teaching order tries to show practical uses of every idea as soon as it is introduced; instructors should resist the temptation to explain the "other 90%" of the language as well.

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book:** The purpose of this book is to inspire and enable anyone who reads it to reconsider the methods they currently employ to analyse data. This is not to suggest that the methodologies outlined will be useful or sufficient for everyone who reads it. Some analyses can be performed quickly without the need for additional computation while others will require advanced analytics techniques not outlined in this book; however, the aspiration is that all will be equipped with novel tools and ideas for approaching data analysis.

The first is to provide an introduction to R programming that doesn't assume any previous experience. The second is to provide a brief sketch of some of things that R can be useful for in psychology. Data analysis inevitably forms a large part of this, but I hope to cover a broader range of topics".

## [Remaster the Tidyverse](https://github.com/rstudio-education/remaster-the-tidyverse)

By [Garrett Grolemund](https://github.com/rstudio-education/remaster-the-tidyverse)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This repository contains editable class materials built by Garrett Grolemund for two separate one-day workshops: **Welcome to the Tidyverse** A gentle introduction to R and its Tidyverse that focuses on learning to do Exploratory Data Analysis with the ggplot2, dplyr, broom, modelr, and rmarkdown packages. The course focuses on doing data science, not writing code; but by the end of the day students will find that they have gained confidence writing code with R.

**Data Wrangling with the Tidyverse** An introduction to wrangling lists and tabular data in R with the tidyr, stringr, forcats, lubridate, and purrr packages. The course focuses on creating and using tidy tables and is designed to be a sequel to Welcome to the Tidyverse.
