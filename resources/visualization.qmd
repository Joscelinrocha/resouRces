Added Fri Feb 18th, 2022

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to data visualisation using R, specifically aimed at researchers who have little to no prior experience of using R.
First we detail the rationale for using R for data visualisation and introduce the "grammar of graphics" that underlies data visualisation using the ggplot2 package.
The tutorial then walks the reader through how to replicate plots that are commonly available in point-and-click software such as histograms and boxplots, as well as showing how the code for these "basic" plots can be easily extended to less commonly available options such as violin-boxplots.

By [Allan Cameron](https://github.com/AllanCameron/geomtextpath)

Added Sat Dec 11th, 2021

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** "The existing text-based geom layers in ggplot2 (geom_text and geom_label) are ideal for the majority of plots, since typically textual annotations are short, straight and in line with the axes of the plot. However, there are some occasions when it is useful to have text follow a curved path. This may be to create or recreate a specific visual effect, or it may be to label a circular / polar plot in a more"natural" way."

## [The Evolution of a ggplot (Ep. 1)](https://cedricscherer.netlify.app/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/)

By [CÃ©dric](https://cedricscherer.netlify.app/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from the blog:** In this series of blog posts, I aim to show you how to turn a default ggplot into a plot that visualizes information in an appealing and easily understandable way.
The goal of each blog post is to provide a step-by-step tutorial explaining how my visualization have evolved from a typical basic ggplot.
All plots are going to be created with 100% {ggplot2} and 0% Inkscape.

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from channel:** TidyX is a screen cast where we select a person's code from the TidyTuesday project and go through their code line-by-line, explaining what they did and how the functions they used work.
We also break down the visualizations they create and talk about how to apply similar approaches to other data sets.
The objective is to help more people learn R and get involved in the TidyTuesday community.
