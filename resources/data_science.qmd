I separate this section from the statistics one because when I needed to learn how to run statistics in R, I would feel frustrated when the documents I found were not directly telling me about specific tests I need to learn about.
It may not be generalizable but it makes sense to me now.
Sorry!

## [A ModernDive into R & the Tidyverse](https://moderndive.com/)

By [Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim. Foreword by Kelly S. McConville](https://moderndive.com/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from ebook:** Over the course of this book, you will develop your "data science toolbox," equipping yourself with tools such as data visualization, data formatting, data wrangling, and data modeling using regression.

In particular, this book will lean heavily on data visualization.
In today's world, we are bombarded with graphics that attempt to convey ideas.
We will explore what makes a good graphic and what the standard ways are used to convey relationships within data.
In general, we'll use visualization as a way of building almost all of the ideas in this book.

**What is this?**

This course is designed for PhD students at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
We are usually pretty flexible about permitting outside students but we want everyone to be aware of the goals and assumptions so no one feels like they are surprised by how the class works.

The primary goal of the course is to teach you how to deconstruct, perform, and communicate professional data analyses across diverse media.

The goal is to help you to organize your thinking around how to combine the things you have learned about statistics, data manipulation, and visualization into complete data analyses that answer important questions about the world around you.

## [Data Analysis for the Life Sciences with R](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences)

By [Rafael A. Irizarry and Michael I Love](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from ebook:** This book will cover several of the statistical concepts and data analytic skills needed to succeed in data-driven life science research.
We go from relatively basic concepts related to computing p-values to advanced topics related to analyzing high-throughput data.
While statistics textbooks focus on mathematics, this book focuses on using a computer to perform data analysis.
Instead of explaining the mathematics and theory, and then showing examples, we start by stating a practical data-related challenge.
This book also includes the computer code that provides a solution to the problem and helps illustrate the concepts behind the solution.

**Excerpt from package:** The goal of grateful is to make it very easy to cite R and the R packages used in any analyses, so that package authors receive their deserved credit.
By calling a single function, grateful will scan the project for R packages used and generate a BibTeX file containing all citations for those packages.

grateful can then generate a new document with citations in the desired output format (Word, PDF, HTML, Markdown).
These references can be formatted for a specific journal, so that we can just paste them directly into our manuscript or report.

## [Using the tidyverse with Databases](https://sciencificity-blog.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-12-using-the-tidyverse-with-databases/)

By [Vebash Naidoo](https://sciencificity-blog.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-12-using-the-tidyverse-with-databases/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** You know R, especially the dplyr 📦.
Even though the dplyr 📦 is so well written to mimic the SQL syntax - select(), group_by(), left_join() etc. there is still a cognitive load when you switch between using R syntax, and SQL syntax (ask me, who has often written == in SQL syntax on Athena only to wonder why I am getting an error 🤐).

You only have so much memory in your local environment, and may want your RDBMS to do the heavy lifting (most of the computation), and only pull data into R when you need to (e.g. pull in aggregated data to create plots for a report).

In this tutorial you will learn how to use dbplyr, which is a database back-end of dplyr, to execute queries directly in your RDBMS all the while writing R tidyverse syntax 😮 ⭐.
