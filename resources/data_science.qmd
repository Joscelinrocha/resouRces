I separate this section from the statistics one because when I needed to learn how to run statistics in R, I would feel frustrated when the documents I found were not directly telling me about specific tests I need to learn about.
It may not be generalizable but it makes sense to me now.
Sorry!

## [A ModernDive into R & the Tidyverse](https://moderndive.com/)

By [Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim. Foreword by Kelly S. McConville](https://moderndive.com/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from ebook:** Over the course of this book, you will develop your "data science toolbox," equipping yourself with tools such as data visualization, data formatting, data wrangling, and data modeling using regression.

In particular, this book will lean heavily on data visualization.
In today's world, we are bombarded with graphics that attempt to convey ideas.
We will explore what makes a good graphic and what the standard ways are used to convey relationships within data.
In general, we'll use visualization as a way of building almost all of the ideas in this book.

## [Advanced Data Science 2020](http://jtleek.com/ads2020/)

By[Jeff Leek and Roger D. Peng](http://jtleek.com/ads2020/)

Added Sep 12th, 2020

**What is this?**

This course is designed for PhD students at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
We are usually pretty flexible about permitting outside students but we want everyone to be aware of the goals and assumptions so no one feels like they are surprised by how the class works.

The primary goal of the course is to teach you how to deconstruct, perform, and communicate professional data analyses across diverse media.

The goal is to help you to organize your thinking around how to combine the things you have learned about statistics, data manipulation, and visualization into complete data analyses that answer important questions about the world around you.

## [Data Analysis for the Life Sciences with R](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences)

By [Rafael A. Irizarry and Michael I Love](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from ebook:** This book will cover several of the statistical concepts and data analytic skills needed to succeed in data-driven life science research.
We go from relatively basic concepts related to computing p-values to advanced topics related to analyzing high-throughput data.
While statistics textbooks focus on mathematics, this book focuses on using a computer to perform data analysis.
Instead of explaining the mathematics and theory, and then showing examples, we start by stating a practical data-related challenge.
This book also includes the computer code that provides a solution to the problem and helps illustrate the concepts behind the solution.

By [Ryan A. Estrellado, Emily A. Bovee, Jesse Mostipak, Joshua M. Rosenberg, & Isabella C. Velásquez](https://datascienceineducation.com/)

Added on Apr 15th, 2021

**What is it?**

**Excerpt from site:** We wrote this book assuming you're at the start of your journey learning R and using data science in your education job.
The book takes you from installing R to practicing more advanced data science skills like text analysis.

If you've never written a line of R code, we welcome you to the community!
We wrote this book for you.
Consider reading the book cover to cover and doing all the analysis walkthroughs.
Remember that you'll get more from a few minutes of practice every day than you will from long hours of practice every once in awhile.
Typing code every day, even if it doesn't always run, is a daily practice that invites learning and "a-ha" moments.

## [Using the tidyverse with Databases](https://sciencificity-blog.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-12-using-the-tidyverse-with-databases/)

By [Vebash Naidoo](https://sciencificity-blog.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-12-using-the-tidyverse-with-databases/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** You know R, especially the dplyr 📦.
Even though the dplyr 📦 is so well written to mimic the SQL syntax - select(), group_by(), left_join() etc. there is still a cognitive load when you switch between using R syntax, and SQL syntax (ask me, who has often written == in SQL syntax on Athena only to wonder why I am getting an error 🤐).

You only have so much memory in your local environment, and may want your RDBMS to do the heavy lifting (most of the computation), and only pull data into R when you need to (e.g. pull in aggregated data to create plots for a report).

In this tutorial you will learn how to use dbplyr, which is a database back-end of dplyr, to execute queries directly in your RDBMS all the while writing R tidyverse syntax 😮 ⭐.
