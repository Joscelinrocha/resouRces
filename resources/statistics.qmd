## [Conversion in Psychology-MsC course](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-conv-f2f/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This book contains the quantitative research methods materials for students on the MSc Conversion in Psychological Studies/Science.
The students are typically a diverse cohort and range from those with no STEM or programming background to engineering and computing science graduates.
Compared to the undergraduate degree, the students are older, and there is a greater incidence of computer anxiety.

The focus for the MSc is to provide a basic but solid competency in core data skills and statistics that can be built on in further study.
Students who wish to push themselves beyond the core competencies are encouraged to consult the MSc Data Skills course where they can learn about e.g., simulation and custom functions.
To support those students who may have very limited computer literacy, the beginning stages are more supported than in the undergraduate programme e.g., with an increased use of screenshots and explanations for terminology.

## [Five different "Cohen's d" statistics for within-subject designs](http://jakewestfall.org/blog/index.php/2016/03/25/five-different-cohens-d-statistics-for-within-subject-designs/)

By [Cookie Scientist](http://jakewestfall.org/blog/index.php/2016/03/25/five-different-cohens-d-statistics-for-within-subject-designs/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from blog:** What I'll show here is that there are at least 5 different and non-equivalent ways that people might compute a d-like effect size (which they would invariably simply call "Cohen's d") for Jeff's dataset, and the resulting effect sizes range from about 0.25 to 1.91.
I'll compare and contrast these procedures and ultimately choose one that I think is the least crazy, if you must compute a standardized effect size (more on that later).

## [Generalized Additive Models](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/)

By [Michael Clark](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The following provides a brief introduction to generalized additive models and some thoughts on getting started within the R environment.
It doesn't assume much more than a basic exposure to regression, and maybe a general idea of R, though not necessarily any particular expertise.
The presentation is of a very applied nature, and such that the topics build upon the familiar and generalize to the less so, with the hope that one can bring the concepts they are comfortable with to the new material.
The audience in mind is a researcher with typical applied science training.

## [Handling missing values in R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/04/handling-missing-values-in-r/)

Added Sun June 6th, 2021

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from blog:** Handling missing values in R, one of the common tasks in data analysis is handling missing values.
In R, missing values are often represented by the symbol NA (not available) or some other value that represents missing values (i.e. 99).
Impossible values (e.g., dividing by zero) are represented by the symbol NaN (not a number)

## [Statistical Modeling and Computation for Educational Scientists](https://zief0002.github.io/modeling/)

By [Andrew Zieffler](https://zief0002.github.io/modeling/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from book:** The content in this "book", as the title suggests, is related to statistical modeling and computation.
More specifically, the content focuses on using the General Linear Model (GLM) to provide statistical evidence that can help answer substantive questions in the educational and social sciences.
It is a book intended for applied practitioners in the educational or social sciences.
The statistical content is hopefully presented in a manner that these domian scientists will find useful, including practical suggestions for analysis and the presentation of results intended to help researchers clearly communicate the results of a data analysis.

## [Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century](https://statsthinking21.org/) 💯

By [Russell Poldrack](https://statsthinking21.org/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The goal of this book is to the tell the story of statistics as it is used today by researchers around the world.
It's a different story than the one told in most introductory statistics books, which focus on teaching how to use a set of tools to acheive very specific goals.
This book focuses on understanding the basic ideas of statistical thinking --- a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and make decisions and predictions, all in the context of the inherent uncertainty that exists in the real world.
It also brings to bear current methods that have only become feasible in light of the amazing increases in computational power that have happened in the last few decades.
Analyses that would have taken years in the 1950's can now be completed in a few seconds on a standard laptop computer, and this power unleashes the ability to use computer simulation to ask questions in new and powerful ways.

## [Statistical rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse: Second edition by Solomon Kurz](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book:** This ebook is based on the second edition of Richard McElreath's (2020a) text, Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan.
My contributions show how to fit the models he covered with Paul Bürkner's brms package (Bürkner, 2017, 2018, 2020c), which makes it easy to fit Bayesian regression models in R (R Core Team, 2020) using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
I also prefer plotting and data wrangling with the packages from the tidyverse (Wickham, 2019; Wickham et al., 2019).
So we'll be using those methods, too.

## [STAT 545 Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](https://stat545.com/) 💯

By [Jenny Bryan](https://stat545.com/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This site is about everything that comes up during data analysis except for statistical modelling and inference.
This might strike you as strange, given R's statistical roots.
First, let me assure you we believe that modelling and inference are important.
But the world already offers a lot of great resources for doing statistics with R.

## [Summary and Analysis of Extension Program Evaluation in R](https://rcompanion.org/handbook/index.html)

By [Salvatore S. Mangiafico](https://rcompanion.org/handbook/index.html)

Added Sun Sep 13th, 2020

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from book:** This book is written for students at the undergraduate level with no prior knowledge of the analysis of experiments, and with no prior knowledge of computer programming.
This being said, students with no background in these areas will need to apply care and dedication in order to understand the material and the computer code used in examples.
These students may also need to explore the optional readings to obtain a better foundation in statistical thinking and theory.

## [Test your model!! Performance package](https://easystats.github.io/performance/index.html)

**What is this?**

Test if your model is a good model!
The primary goal of the performance package is to provide utilities for computing indices of model quality and goodness of fit.
This includes measures like r-squared (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE) or intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), but also functions to check (mixed) models for overdispersion, zero-inflation, convergence or singularity.

## [(What to do) When Predictors Co-Vary](https://shouldbewriting.netlify.app/posts/2020-08-11-when-predictors-covary/)

By [Mattan S. Ben-Shachar](https://shouldbewriting.netlify.app/posts/2020-08-11-when-predictors-covary/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from blog:** Co-varying predictors can be a messy business.
They make estimates unstable, reducing our statistical power and making interpretation more difficult.
In this post I will demonstrate how ignoring the presence of co-variation between predictors when exploring our models can lead to odd results and how we might deal with this issue.

# Power Analysis

This section has all resources I encounter to run power analysis regardless of them using R or not.

## [**powerLATE**](https://github.com/kbansak/powerLATE):

Excerpt from site: powerLATE implements the generalized power analysis for the local average treatment effect (LATE), proposed by Bansak (2020).

Power analysis is in the context of estimating the LATE (also known as the complier average causal effect, or CACE), with calculations based on a test of the null hypothesis that the LATE equals 0 with a two-sided alternative.
The method uses standardized effect sizes to place a conservative bound on the power under minimal assumptions.
powerLATE allows users to recover power, sample size requirements, or minimum detectable effect sizes.
It also allows users to work with absolute effects rather than effect sizes, to specify an additional assumption to narrow the bounds, and to incorporate covariate adjustment.

## [**Simulation for Power Analysis by Nick Huntington-Klein**](https://nickch-k.github.io/EconometricsSlides/Week_08/Power_Simulations.html):

Excerpt from site: In this document we'll talk about power analysis in general and how it's done, and then we'll go into how to perform a power analysis using simulation in R, making use of tools from the tidyverse.
