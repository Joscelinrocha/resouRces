## [Conversion in Psychology-MsC course](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-conv-f2f/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This book contains the quantitative research methods materials for students on the MSc Conversion in Psychological Studies/Science.
The students are typically a diverse cohort and range from those with no STEM or programming background to engineering and computing science graduates.
Compared to the undergraduate degree, the students are older, and there is a greater incidence of computer anxiety.

The focus for the MSc is to provide a basic but solid competency in core data skills and statistics that can be built on in further study.
Students who wish to push themselves beyond the core competencies are encouraged to consult the MSc Data Skills course where they can learn about e.g., simulation and custom functions.
To support those students who may have very limited computer literacy, the beginning stages are more supported than in the undergraduate programme e.g., with an increased use of screenshots and explanations for terminology.

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
It can be installed on a variety of operating systems, including the MacOS, Windows, and UNIX platforms.
To really make use of the computational power of R, we are also going to introduce you to RStudio, an open-source front-end1 to R.

The initial chapters of this document will address:

Installing R and RStudio; Getting started with R's computational syntax; Wrangling data using functions from the dplyr package; and Visualizing data using functions from the ggplot2 package.

## [DHARMa - Residual Diagnostics for HierARchical Models](https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from repo:** The 'DHARMa' package uses a simulation-based approach to create readily interpretable scaled (quantile) residuals for fitted (generalized) linear mixed models.
Currently supported are linear and generalized linear (mixed) models from 'lme4' (classes 'lmerMod', 'glmerMod'), 'glmmTMB' 'GLMMadaptive' and 'spaMM', generalized additive models ('gam' from 'mgcv'), 'glm' (including 'negbin' from 'MASS', but excluding quasi-distributions) and 'lm' model classes.
Moreover, externally created simulations, e.g. posterior predictive simulations from Bayesian software such as 'JAGS', 'STAN', or 'BUGS' can be processed as well.

## [Five different "Cohen's d" statistics for within-subject designs](http://jakewestfall.org/blog/index.php/2016/03/25/five-different-cohens-d-statistics-for-within-subject-designs/)

By [Cookie Scientist](http://jakewestfall.org/blog/index.php/2016/03/25/five-different-cohens-d-statistics-for-within-subject-designs/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from blog:** What I'll show here is that there are at least 5 different and non-equivalent ways that people might compute a d-like effect size (which they would invariably simply call "Cohen's d") for Jeff's dataset, and the resulting effect sizes range from about 0.25 to 1.91.
I'll compare and contrast these procedures and ultimately choose one that I think is the least crazy, if you must compute a standardized effect size (more on that later).

## [Generalized Additive Models](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/)

By [Michael Clark](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The following provides a brief introduction to generalized additive models and some thoughts on getting started within the R environment.
It doesn't assume much more than a basic exposure to regression, and maybe a general idea of R, though not necessarily any particular expertise.
The presentation is of a very applied nature, and such that the topics build upon the familiar and generalize to the less so, with the hope that one can bring the concepts they are comfortable with to the new material.
The audience in mind is a researcher with typical applied science training.

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from course:** The goal of this course is to give you the skills to do the statistics that are in current published papers, and make pretty figures to show off your results.
While we will go over the mathematical concepts behind the statistics, this is NOT meant to be a classical statistics class.
We will focus more on making the connection between the mathematical equation and the R code, and what types of variables fit into each slot of the equation.

## [Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century](https://statsthinking21.org/) 💯

By [Russell Poldrack](https://statsthinking21.org/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The goal of this book is to the tell the story of statistics as it is used today by researchers around the world.
It's a different story than the one told in most introductory statistics books, which focus on teaching how to use a set of tools to acheive very specific goals.
This book focuses on understanding the basic ideas of statistical thinking --- a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and make decisions and predictions, all in the context of the inherent uncertainty that exists in the real world.
It also brings to bear current methods that have only become feasible in light of the amazing increases in computational power that have happened in the last few decades.
Analyses that would have taken years in the 1950's can now be completed in a few seconds on a standard laptop computer, and this power unleashes the ability to use computer simulation to ask questions in new and powerful ways.

## [Statistical rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse: Second edition by Solomon Kurz](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book:** This ebook is based on the second edition of Richard McElreath's (2020a) text, Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan.
My contributions show how to fit the models he covered with Paul Bürkner's brms package (Bürkner, 2017, 2018, 2020c), which makes it easy to fit Bayesian regression models in R (R Core Team, 2020) using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
I also prefer plotting and data wrangling with the packages from the tidyverse (Wickham, 2019; Wickham et al., 2019).
So we'll be using those methods, too.

## [(What to do) When Predictors Co-Vary](https://shouldbewriting.netlify.app/posts/2020-08-11-when-predictors-covary/)

By [Mattan S. Ben-Shachar](https://shouldbewriting.netlify.app/posts/2020-08-11-when-predictors-covary/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from blog:** Co-varying predictors can be a messy business.
They make estimates unstable, reducing our statistical power and making interpretation more difficult.
In this post I will demonstrate how ignoring the presence of co-variation between predictors when exploring our models can lead to odd results and how we might deal with this issue.

# Power Analysis

This section has all resources I encounter to run power analysis regardless of them using R or not.

## [**powerLATE**](https://github.com/kbansak/powerLATE):

Excerpt from site: powerLATE implements the generalized power analysis for the local average treatment effect (LATE), proposed by Bansak (2020).

Power analysis is in the context of estimating the LATE (also known as the complier average causal effect, or CACE), with calculations based on a test of the null hypothesis that the LATE equals 0 with a two-sided alternative.
The method uses standardized effect sizes to place a conservative bound on the power under minimal assumptions.
powerLATE allows users to recover power, sample size requirements, or minimum detectable effect sizes.
It also allows users to work with absolute effects rather than effect sizes, to specify an additional assumption to narrow the bounds, and to incorporate covariate adjustment.

## [**Simulation for Power Analysis by Nick Huntington-Klein**](https://nickch-k.github.io/EconometricsSlides/Week_08/Power_Simulations.html):

Excerpt from site: In this document we'll talk about power analysis in general and how it's done, and then we'll go into how to perform a power analysis using simulation in R, making use of tools from the tidyverse.
