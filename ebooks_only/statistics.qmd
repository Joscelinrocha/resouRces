R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
It can be installed on a variety of operating systems, including the MacOS, Windows, and UNIX platforms.
To really make use of the computational power of R, we are also going to introduce you to RStudio, an open-source front-end1 to R.

The initial chapters of this document will address:

Installing R and RStudio; Getting started with R's computational syntax; Wrangling data using functions from the dplyr package; and Visualizing data using functions from the ggplot2 package.

## [Generalized Additive Models](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/)

By [Michael Clark](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The following provides a brief introduction to generalized additive models and some thoughts on getting started within the R environment.
It doesn't assume much more than a basic exposure to regression, and maybe a general idea of R, though not necessarily any particular expertise.
The presentation is of a very applied nature, and such that the topics build upon the familiar and generalize to the less so, with the hope that one can bring the concepts they are comfortable with to the new material.
The audience in mind is a researcher with typical applied science training.

## [R for Data Analysis](https://trevorfrench.github.io/R-for-Data-Analysis/?es_id=aaa755b1d8)

By [Trevor French](https://trevorfrench.github.io/R-for-Data-Analysis/?es_id=aaa755b1d8)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book:** The purpose of this book is to inspire and enable anyone who reads it to reconsider the methods they currently employ to analyse data.
This is not to suggest that the methodologies outlined will be useful or sufficient for everyone who reads it.
Some analyses can be performed quickly without the need for additional computation while others will require advanced analytics techniques not outlined in this book; however, the aspiration is that all will be equipped with novel tools and ideas for approaching data analysis.

## [Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century](https://statsthinking21.org/) 💯

By [Russell Poldrack](https://statsthinking21.org/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The goal of this book is to the tell the story of statistics as it is used today by researchers around the world.
It's a different story than the one told in most introductory statistics books, which focus on teaching how to use a set of tools to acheive very specific goals.
This book focuses on understanding the basic ideas of statistical thinking --- a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and make decisions and predictions, all in the context of the inherent uncertainty that exists in the real world.
It also brings to bear current methods that have only become feasible in light of the amazing increases in computational power that have happened in the last few decades.
Analyses that would have taken years in the 1950's can now be completed in a few seconds on a standard laptop computer, and this power unleashes the ability to use computer simulation to ask questions in new and powerful ways.

## [Statistical rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse: Second edition](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/)

By [Solomon Kurz](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book:** This ebook is based on the second edition of Richard McElreath's (2020a) text, Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan.
My contributions show how to fit the models he covered with Paul Bürkner's brms package (Bürkner, 2017, 2018, 2020c), which makes it easy to fit Bayesian regression models in R (R Core Team, 2020) using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
I also prefer plotting and data wrangling with the packages from the tidyverse (Wickham, 2019; Wickham et al., 2019).
So we'll be using those methods, too.
