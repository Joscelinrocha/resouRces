## [Conversion in Psychology-MsC course](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-conv-f2f/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This book contains the quantitative research methods materials for students on the MSc Conversion in Psychological Studies/Science.
The students are typically a diverse cohort and range from those with no STEM or programming background to engineering and computing science graduates.
Compared to the undergraduate degree, the students are older, and there is a greater incidence of computer anxiety.

The focus for the MSc is to provide a basic but solid competency in core data skills and statistics that can be built on in further study.
Students who wish to push themselves beyond the core competencies are encouraged to consult the MSc Data Skills course where they can learn about e.g., simulation and custom functions.
To support those students who may have very limited computer literacy, the beginning stages are more supported than in the undergraduate programme e.g., with an increased use of screenshots and explanations for terminology.

## [Computational Toolkit for Educational Scientists](https://zief0002.github.io/toolkit/statistical-computation.html#statistical-computation)

By [Andrew Zieffler](https://zief0002.github.io/toolkit/statistical-computation.html#statistical-computation)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from ebook:** The first set of tools we will discuss will be related to statistical computation.
Although there are many computational tools for statistical analysis, the first tools we will add to your computational toolkit is R.
R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
It can be installed on a variety of operating systems, including the MacOS, Windows, and UNIX platforms.
To really make use of the computational power of R, we are also going to introduce you to RStudio, an open-source front-end1 to R.

The initial chapters of this document will address:

Installing R and RStudio; Getting started with R's computational syntax; Wrangling data using functions from the dplyr package; and Visualizing data using functions from the ggplot2 package.

## [Generalized Additive Models](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/)

By [Michael Clark](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The following provides a brief introduction to generalized additive models and some thoughts on getting started within the R environment.
It doesn't assume much more than a basic exposure to regression, and maybe a general idea of R, though not necessarily any particular expertise.
The presentation is of a very applied nature, and such that the topics build upon the familiar and generalize to the less so, with the hope that one can bring the concepts they are comfortable with to the new material.
The audience in mind is a researcher with typical applied science training.

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from ebook:** This book is adapted from a series of ten posts on my blog, starting with Understanding the beta distribution and ending recently with Simulation of empirical Bayesian methods.
In these posts I've introduced the empirical Bayesian approach to estimation, credible intervals, A/B testing, mixture models, and other methods, all through the example of baseball batting averages.

## [PsyTeachR University of Glasgow](https://psyteachr.github.io/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The psyTeachR team at the University of Glasgow School of Psychology and Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology has successfully made the transition to teaching reproducible research using R across all undergraduate and postgraduate levels.
Our curriculum now emphasizes essential 'data science' graduate skills that have been overlooked in traditional approaches to teaching, including programming skills, data visualisation, data wrangling and reproducible reports.
Students learn about probability and inference through data simulation as well as by working with real datasets.

This website contains our open materials for teaching reproducible research.

## [Statistical Modeling and Computation for Educational Scientists](https://zief0002.github.io/modeling/)

By [Andrew Zieffler](https://zief0002.github.io/modeling/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from book:** The content in this "book", as the title suggests, is related to statistical modeling and computation.
More specifically, the content focuses on using the General Linear Model (GLM) to provide statistical evidence that can help answer substantive questions in the educational and social sciences.
It is a book intended for applied practitioners in the educational or social sciences.
The statistical content is hopefully presented in a manner that these domian scientists will find useful, including practical suggestions for analysis and the presentation of results intended to help researchers clearly communicate the results of a data analysis.

## [Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century](https://statsthinking21.org/) 💯

By [Russell Poldrack](https://statsthinking21.org/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The goal of this book is to the tell the story of statistics as it is used today by researchers around the world.
It's a different story than the one told in most introductory statistics books, which focus on teaching how to use a set of tools to acheive very specific goals.
This book focuses on understanding the basic ideas of statistical thinking --- a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and make decisions and predictions, all in the context of the inherent uncertainty that exists in the real world.
It also brings to bear current methods that have only become feasible in light of the amazing increases in computational power that have happened in the last few decades.
Analyses that would have taken years in the 1950's can now be completed in a few seconds on a standard laptop computer, and this power unleashes the ability to use computer simulation to ask questions in new and powerful ways.

## [Statistical rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse: Second edition](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/)

By [Solomon Kurz](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book:** This ebook is based on the second edition of Richard McElreath's (2020a) text, Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan.
My contributions show how to fit the models he covered with Paul Bürkner's brms package (Bürkner, 2017, 2018, 2020c), which makes it easy to fit Bayesian regression models in R (R Core Team, 2020) using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
I also prefer plotting and data wrangling with the packages from the tidyverse (Wickham, 2019; Wickham et al., 2019).
So we'll be using those methods, too.

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book:** Vincent is trying to replicate (nearly) all the models in Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking (2nd ed.) book using Stan, R, rstan, tidybayes, and ggplot2.

## [STAT 545 Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](https://stat545.com/) 💯

By [Jenny Bryan](https://stat545.com/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This site is about everything that comes up during data analysis except for statistical modelling and inference.
This might strike you as strange, given R's statistical roots.
First, let me assure you we believe that modelling and inference are important.
But the world already offers a lot of great resources for doing statistics with R.

## [Summary and Analysis of Extension Program Evaluation in R](https://rcompanion.org/handbook/index.html)

By [Salvatore S. Mangiafico](https://rcompanion.org/handbook/index.html)

Added Sun Sep 13th, 2020

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from book:** This book is written for students at the undergraduate level with no prior knowledge of the analysis of experiments, and with no prior knowledge of computer programming.
This being said, students with no background in these areas will need to apply care and dedication in order to understand the material and the computer code used in examples.
These students may also need to explore the optional readings to obtain a better foundation in statistical thinking and theory.
