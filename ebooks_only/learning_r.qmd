## [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) 🌳🌳

By [Hadley Wickham](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)

**What is this?**

Excerpt from site: This is the website for 2nd edition of "Advanced R", a book in Chapman & Hall's R Series. The book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as it helps you to understand why R works the way it does.

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This is the website for "Hands-On Programming with R". This book will teach you how to program in R, with hands-on examples. I wrote it for non-programmers to provide a friendly introduction to the R language. You'll learn how to load data, assemble and disassemble data objects, navigate R's environment system, write your own functions, and use all of R's programming tools.

## [Just Enough R](https://benwhalley.github.io/just-enough-r/) 🌱

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book here:** R makes it easy to work with and learn from data.

It also happens to be a programmming language, but if you're reading this, that might not be of interest. That's OK --- the goal here is not to teach programming1. The goal is to teach you just enough R to be confident to explore your data.

This book uses R like any other statistics software: To work-with and visualize data, run statistical analyses, and share our results with others. To do that you don't need more than the absolute basics of the R language itself.

## [Modelling and visualizing data using R: A practical introduction](https://www.danielnettle.org.uk/r-modelling/)

By [Daniel Nettle](https://www.danielnettle.org.uk/r-modelling/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This is a basic overview of using R for data analysis, and of linear statistical modelling. It would be suitable for anyone who has had some stats training but not used R; or has used R a little but not become confident; or has neither had stats training nor used R but is not happy with a reasonably steep learning curve. The emphasis is on rapidly getting to be able to use R for most of the common practical purposes, and knowing that you can take it further should you need to. It is designed for you to be able to work through on your own.

## [R for Data Analysis](https://trevorfrench.github.io/R-for-Data-Analysis/?es_id=aaa755b1d8)

By [Trevor French](https://trevorfrench.github.io/R-for-Data-Analysis/?es_id=aaa755b1d8)

Added Fri Apr 14th, 2023

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book:** The purpose of this book is to inspire and enable anyone who reads it to reconsider the methods they currently employ to analyse data.
This is not to suggest that the methodologies outlined will be useful or sufficient for everyone who reads it.
Some analyses can be performed quickly without the need for additional computation while others will require advanced analytics techniques not outlined in this book; however, the aspiration is that all will be equipped with novel tools and ideas for approaching data analysis.

My focus will be on introducing a workflow that uses a wide variety of different tools and packages, including readr, dplyr, tidyr, and shiny. I'll assume basic familiarity with R and will use (but not spend too much time teaching) ggplot2. Featuring data from http://wordbank.stanford.edu

## [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://rstats.wtf/index.html) 🌳

By [Jennifer Bryan & Jim Hester](https://rstats.wtf/index.html)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The initial impetus for creating these materials is a two-day hands-on workshop. The in-person workshops are still the primary delivery method for this content, but we've begun recording prose versions of this content, in order to make it more widely available and for participants to refer back to. Warning: these materials absolutely do not constitute a self-contained "book", nor do they capture all workshop content.
