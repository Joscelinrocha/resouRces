It’s a different story than the one told in most introductory statistics books, which focus on teaching how to use a set of tools to acheive very specific goals. This book focuses on understanding the basic ideas of statistical thinking — a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and make decisions and predictions, all in the context of the inherent uncertainty that exists in the real world. It also brings to bear current methods that have only become feasible in light of the amazing increases in computational power that have happened in the last few decades. Analyses that would have taken years in the 1950’s can now be completed in a few seconds on a standard laptop computer, and this power unleashes the ability to use computer simulation to ask questions in new and powerful ways.\n\nLink to site here: https://statsthinking21.org/\nLink to core text here: https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/\nLink to R repo here: https://github.com/statsthinking21/statsthinking21-R\nLink to Python repo here (under work now): https://github.com/statsthinking21/statsthinking21-python"

My focus will be on introducing a workflow that uses a wide variety of different tools and packages, including readr, dplyr, tidyr, and shiny. I’ll assume basic familiarity with R and will use (but not spend too much time teaching) ggplot2. Featuring data from http://wordbank.stanford.edu\n\nLink to the tutorial here: https://github.com/mcfrank/tidyverse-tutorial"

The audience of the original workshop were graduate psychology students at the University of Vienna with a focus on research methods. Most statistical and methodical elements were already discussed, yet the implementation in R was new to all of them. And programming in general was new to most of them. I therefore introduced R very shortly, before explaining the actual meta-analytical analyses more briefly. I added some explanations and references to make the file more self-explanatory for independent study. Therefore, this post also contains materials and references on how to install R, R Studio, and some basic concepts of programming.\n\nPost here: https://constantinyvesplessen.com/post/workshop_meta_analysis/\nDataset and code here: https://osf.io/y9d2w/"

These include e.g. measures like r-squared, intraclass correlation coefficient (Nakagawa, Johnson & Schielzeth (2017) doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0213), root mean squared error or functions to check models for overdispersion, singularity or zero-inflation and more. Functions apply to a large variety of regression models, including generalized linear models, mixed effects models and Bayesian models.\n\nLink to review video by Yury Zablotski here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR296jgFcxLDNHE0zatJlMWGFb8RTVcWfYpRQ9261wzvlacp8M0BDs1K3iI&v=EPIxQ5i5oxs&feature=youtu.be\nLink to CRAN vignette here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/performance/performance.pdf\nLink to repo here: https://easystats.github.io/performance/"

The students are typically a diverse cohort and range from those with no STEM or programming background to engineering and computing science graduates. Compared to the undergraduate degree, the students are older, and there is a greater incidence of computer anxiety.\nThe focus for the MSc is to provide a basic but solid competency in core data skills and statistics that can be built on in further study. Students who wish to push themselves beyond the core competencies are encouraged to consult the MSc Data Skills course where they can learn about e.g., simulation and custom functions. To support those students who may have very limited computer literacy, the beginning stages are more supported than in the undergraduate programme e.g., with an increased use of screenshots and explanations for terminology.\n\nCourse is here: https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-conv-f2f/"

It’s a different story than the one told in most introductory statistics books, which focus on teaching how to use a set of tools to acheive very specific goals. This book focuses on understanding the basic ideas of statistical thinking — a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and make decisions and predictions, all in the context of the inherent uncertainty that exists in the real world. It also brings to bear current methods that have only become feasible in light of the amazing increases in computational power that have happened in the last few decades. Analyses that would have taken years in the 1950’s can now be completed in a few seconds on a standard laptop computer, and this power unleashes the ability to use computer simulation to ask questions in new and powerful ways.\n\nLink to site here: https://statsthinking21.org/\nLink to core text here: https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/\nLink to R repo here: https://github.com/statsthinking21/statsthinking21-R\nLink to Python repo here (under work now): https://github.com/statsthinking21/statsthinking21-python"

The method uses standardized effect sizes to place a conservative bound on the power under minimal assumptions. powerLATE allows users to recover power, sample size requirements, or minimum detectable effect sizes.

    "text": "Programming with R\nBy The Carpentries\nWhat is this?\nExcerpt from site: This lesson is written as an introduction to R, but its real purpose is to introduce the single most important idea in programming: how to solve problems by building functions, each of which can fit in a programmer’s working memory. In order to teach that, we must teach people a little about the mechanics of manipulating data with lists and file I/O so that their functions can do things they actually care about. Our teaching order tries to show practical uses of every idea as soon as it is introduced; instructors should resist the temptation to explain the “other 90%” of the language as well.\n\nCourse here: https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/"

Currently supported are linear and generalized linear (mixed) models from ‘lme4’ (classes ‘lmerMod’, ‘glmerMod’), ‘glmmTMB’ ‘GLMMadaptive’ and ‘spaMM’, generalized additive models (‘gam’ from ‘mgcv’), ‘glm’ (including ‘negbin’ from ‘MASS’, but excluding quasi-distributions) and ‘lm’ model classes. Moreover, externally created simulations, e.g. posterior predictive simulations from Bayesian software such as ‘JAGS’, ‘STAN’, or ‘BUGS’ can be processed as well.\n\nLink to repo here: https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa",

I’ll compare and contrast these procedures and ultimately choose one that I think is the least crazy, if you must compute a standardized effect size (more on that later).\n\nLink to blog here: http://jakewestfall.org/blog/index.php/2016/03/25/five-different-cohens-d-statistics-for-within-subject-designs/",

It doesn’t assume much more than a basic exposure to regression, and maybe a general idea of R, though not necessarily any particular expertise. The presentation is of a very applied nature, and such that the topics build upon the familiar and generalize to the less so, with the hope that one can bring the concepts they are comfortable with to the new material. The audience in mind is a researcher with typical applied science training.\n\nLink to ebook: https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/",

It’s a different story than the one told in most introductory statistics books, which focus on teaching how to use a set of tools to acheive very specific goals. This book focuses on understanding the basic ideas of statistical thinking — a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and make decisions and predictions, all in the context of the inherent uncertainty that exists in the real world. It also brings to bear current methods that have only become feasible in light of the amazing increases in computational power that have happened in the last few decades. Analyses that would have taken years in the 1950’s can now be completed in a few seconds on a standard laptop computer, and this power unleashes the ability to use computer simulation to ask questions in new and powerful ways.\n\nLink to site here: https://statsthinking21.org/\nLink to core text here: https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/\nLink to R repo here: https://github.com/statsthinking21/statsthinking21-R\nLink to Python repo here (under work now): https://github.com/statsthinking21/statsthinking21-python",

I also prefer plotting and data wrangling with the packages from the tidyverse (Wickham, 2019; Wickham et al., 2019).

The method uses standardized effect sizes to place a conservative bound on the power under minimal assumptions. powerLATE allows users to recover power, sample size requirements, or minimum detectable effect sizes.

This class assumes zero knowledge of programming, computer science, linear algebra, probability, or really anything fancy. I encourage anyone who is quant-curious to work their way through these course notes. The course notes include lectures, worked examples, readings, activities, and labs.\n\nLink to website: https://datascience4psych.github.io/DataScience4Psych/",

Velásquez\nAdded on Apr 15th, 2021\nWhat is it?\nExcerpt from site: We wrote this book assuming you’re at the start of your journey learning R and using data science in your education job. The book takes you from installing R to practicing more advanced data science skills like text analysis.\nIf you’ve never written a line of R code, we welcome you to the community! We wrote this book for you. Consider reading the book cover to cover and doing all the analysis walkthroughs. Remember that you’ll get more from a few minutes of practice every day than you will from long hours of practice every once in awhile. Typing code every day, even if it doesn’t always run, is a daily practice that invites learning and “a-ha” moments.\n\nLink to e-book: https://datascienceineducation.com/",

First we detail the rationale for using R for data visualisation and introduce the “grammar of graphics” that underlies data visualisation using the ggplot2 package. The tutorial then walks the reader through how to replicate plots that are commonly available in point-and-click software such as histograms and boxplots, as well as showing how the code for these “basic” plots can be easily extended to less commonly available options such as violin-boxplots.\n\nLink to site here: https://psyteachr.github.io/introdataviz/\nLink to dataset here: https://osf.io/bj83f/\nLink to published manuscript here: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/25152459221074654",

The audience of the original workshop were graduate psychology students at the University of Vienna with a focus on research methods. Most statistical and methodical elements were already discussed, yet the implementation in R was new to all of them. And programming in general was new to most of them. I therefore introduced R very shortly, before explaining the actual meta-analytical analyses more briefly. I added some explanations and references to make the file more self-explanatory for independent study. Therefore, this post also contains materials and references on how to install R, R Studio, and some basic concepts of programming.\n\nPost here: https://constantinyvesplessen.com/post/workshop_meta_analysis/\nDataset and code here: https://osf.io/y9d2w/",

The workshop is designed as an introduction to R. Zero programming experience is required. By the end of the workshop, you’ll have a “feel” for what R is and what it can do for you, and we’ll provide resources for follow-up self-study.\n\nCourse materials here: https://osf.io/69gub/",

In order to teach that, we must teach people a little about the mechanics of manipulating data with lists and file I/O so that their functions can do things they actually care about. Our teaching order tries to show practical uses of every idea as soon as it is introduced; instructors should resist the temptation to explain the “other 90%” of the language as well.\n\nCourse here: https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/",

Better yet, please fork the repo and submit an upstream pull request. I’m very grateful for any contributions, but may be slow to respond (trying to get a doctorate done). I try my best to assign the resources in the categories I have listed but sometimes they are ambiguous. If I have time I put them in both categories but I usually don’t. If you think something really doesn’t belong in a certain category or the information is wrong such as authors names, summaries, or even links, just open an issue.\nWhy are you doing this?\nI struggled a lot getting resources to learn how to code. I started with python which I love but it wasn’t until I found the R community that I felt welcomed. I really admire all the people that make these resources available for anyone to learn and teach this language. I used to collect all the available resources and bookmarked them or emailed them to myself but I figure hundred of people do this as well so just wanted to help.\nWhat can you do to thank me?\nThis is a weird thing that someone asked me.

If you don’t already have a workflow to edit files and sync to GitHub from your computer, I recommend RStudio. You don’t need to know R to use RStudio, and it has powerful editor features that make for happy workflows.\n\nLink to blog here: https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/",

If you don't already have a workflow to edit files and sync to GitHub from your computer, I recommend RStudio. You don't need to know R to use RStudio, and it has powerful editor features that make for happy workflows.\n\nLink to blog here: https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/",

The focus is on structural MRI file formats from the FreeSurfer brain imaging software suite, but a range of other file formats are supported as well. The package can be used to read 3D and 4D volume files (brain models, segemntations, voxel-wise results), 2D surface-based morphometry data (e.g., cortical thickness maps), brain surface meshes, atlas-based parcellations and labels, surface patches, and spatial transformation matrices in various file formats. The vast majority of formats can also be written. The related ‘fsbrain’ package can be used to visualize neuroimaging data directly in R.\n\nLink to package summary: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/fsformats/\nLink to repo: https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/freesurferformats",

The audience of the original workshop were graduate psychology students at the University of Vienna with a focus on research methods. Most statistical and methodical elements were already discussed, yet the implementation in R was new to all of them. And programming in general was new to most of them. I therefore introduced R very shortly, before explaining the actual meta-analytical analyses more briefly. I added some explanations and references to make the file more self-explanatory for independent study. Therefore, this post also contains materials and references on how to install R, R Studio, and some basic concepts of programming.\n\nPost here: https://constantinyvesplessen.com/post/workshop_meta_analysis/\nDataset and code here: https://osf.io/y9d2w/"

If you don’t already have a workflow to edit files and sync to GitHub from your computer, I recommend RStudio.

We go from relatively basic concepts related to computing p-values to advanced topics related to analyzing high-throughput data. While statistics textbooks focus on mathematics, this book focuses on using a computer to perform data analysis. Instead of explaining the mathematics and theory, and then showing examples, we start by stating a practical data-related challenge. This book also includes the computer code that provides a solution to the problem and helps illustrate the concepts behind the solution.\n\nLink to ebook: https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences"

Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data you have. We will cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing informative data graphics. We will also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.\n\nhttps://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/"
