Or, you can watch or ‚≠ê star the repo to get notified automatically for any changes or new additions.\nI‚Äôve spotted a mistake or would like to contribute\nPlease open a new issue. Better yet, please fork the repo and submit an upstream pull request. I‚Äôm very grateful for any contributions, but may be slow to respond (trying to get a doctorate done). I try my best to assign the resources in the categories I have listed but sometimes they are ambiguous. If I have time I put them in both categories but I usually don‚Äôt. If you think something really doesn‚Äôt belong in a certain category or the information is wrong such as authors names, summaries, or even links, just open an issue.\nWhy are you doing this?\nI struggled a lot getting resources to learn how to code. I started with python which I love but it wasn‚Äôt until I found the R community that I felt welcomed. I really admire all the people that make these resources available for anyone to learn and teach this language. I used to collect all the available resources and bookmarked them or emailed them to myself but I figure hundred of people do this as well so just wanted to help.\nWhat can you do to thank me?\nThis is a weird thing that someone asked me. I just would really appreciate it if you share it with your peers and especially BIPOC young people who otherwise cannot afford expensive courses to learn this skill.\nIf you would like to do something else you can Buy me a Coffee or Venmo me at @JoscelinRocha\n\n\n\n Back to top"

This blog post shows you how. Back in April 2022, I participated in the #30DayChartChallenge and for the Storytelling prompt on day 29 in the Uncertainty category, I created the Goldilocks Decision Tree. I also gave a talk to R-Ladies Nairobi on the challenge and used the flowchart as a live-coding example.

It would be suitable for anyone who has had some stats training but not used R; or has used R a little but not become confident; or has neither had stats training nor used R but is not happy with a reasonably steep learning curve. The emphasis is on rapidly getting to be able to use R for most of the common practical purposes, and knowing that you can take it further should you need to. It is designed for you to be able to work through on your own.\n\nLink to pdf for intro: https://www.danielnettle.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/funwithR3.0.pdf\nData files used for this intro: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7s14m6ceph3laja/AAAIGT7jBZ3n6aIBR8-IT8R4a?dl=0"

It doesn‚Äôt assume much more than a basic exposure to regression, and maybe a general idea of R, though not necessarily any particular expertise. The presentation is of a very applied nature, and such that the topics build upon the familiar and generalize to the less so, with the hope that one can bring the concepts they are comfortable with to the new material. The audience in mind is a researcher with typical applied science training.\n\nLink to ebook: https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/"

It was designed to advance the understanding of the developmental pathways of both positive and negative human social behaviors. In particular, the project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency, adult crime, substance abuse, and violence. At the same time, the project also provided a detailed look at the environments in which these social behaviors take place by collecting substantial amounts of data about urban Chicago, including its people, institutions, and resources.\n\nLink to list of datasets here: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/series/206\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The method uses standardized effect sizes to place a conservative bound on the power under minimal assumptions. powerLATE allows users to recover power, sample size requirements, or minimum detectable effect sizes. It also allows users to work with absolute effects rather than effect sizes, to specify an additional assumption to narrow the bounds, and to incorporate covariate adjustment."

The audience of the original workshop were graduate psychology students at the University of Vienna with a focus on research methods. Most statistical and methodical elements were already discussed, yet the implementation in R was new to all of them. And programming in general was new to most of them. I therefore introduced R very shortly, before explaining the actual meta-analytical analyses more briefly. I added some explanations and references to make the file more self-explanatory for independent study. Therefore, this post also contains materials and references on how to install R, R Studio, and some basic concepts of programming.\n\nPost here: https://constantinyvesplessen.com/post/workshop_meta_analysis/\nDataset and code here: https://osf.io/y9d2w/"

This is not to suggest that the methodologies outlined will be useful or sufficient for everyone who reads it. Some analyses can be performed quickly without the need for additional computation while others will require advanced analytics techniques not outlined in this book; however, the aspiration is that all will be equipped with novel tools and ideas for approaching data analysis.\n\nLink to e-book here: https://trevorfrench.github.io/R-for-Data-Analysis/?es_id=aaa755b1d8"

Once you understand the basic ideas of supervised machine learning, the next step is to practice your skills so you know how to apply these techniques wisely and appropriately. In this course, you will work through four case studies using data from the real world; you will gain experience in exploratory data analysis, preparing data so it is ready for predictive modeling, training supervised machine learning models using tidymodels, and evaluating those models.\n\nLink to course: https://supervised-ml-course.netlify.app/"

It includes functions for importing data from a variety of file formats (including Biosemi, Brain Vision Analyzer, and EEGLAB), many of the typical steps in pre-preprocessing (filtering, referencing, artefact rejection), more advanced processing techniques (time-frequency analysis, ICA), and many types of plot that are common in the field (ERP plots, time-frequency plots, topographical scalp maps). Although it uses custom object classes, it is designed such that these are always translatable to standard R data.frames, and thus can be used with any of the myriad packages and methods that support standard R formats.\n\nLink to documentation here: https://neuroconductor.org/help/eegUtils/\nLink to repo here: https://github.com/craddm/eegUtils/"

The focus is on structural MRI file formats from the FreeSurfer brain imaging software suite, but a range of other file formats are supported as well. The package can be used to read 3D and 4D volume files (brain models, segemntations, voxel-wise results), 2D surface-based morphometry data (e.g., cortical thickness maps), brain surface meshes, atlas-based parcellations and labels, surface patches, and spatial transformation matrices in various file formats. The vast majority of formats can also be written. The related ‚Äòfsbrain‚Äô package can be used to visualize neuroimaging data directly in R.\n\nLink to package summary: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/fsformats/\nLink to repo: https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/freesurferformats"

It‚Äôs a different story than the one told in most introductory statistics books, which focus on teaching how to use a set of tools to acheive very specific goals. This book focuses on understanding the basic ideas of statistical thinking ‚Äî a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and make decisions and predictions, all in the context of the inherent uncertainty that exists in the real world. It also brings to bear current methods that have only become feasible in light of the amazing increases in computational power that have happened in the last few decades. Analyses that would have taken years in the 1950‚Äôs can now be completed in a few seconds on a standard laptop computer, and this power unleashes the ability to use computer simulation to ask questions in new and powerful ways.\n\nLink to site here: https://statsthinking21.org/\nLink to core text here: https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/\nLink to R repo here: https://github.com/statsthinking21/statsthinking21-R\nLink to Python repo here (under work now): https://github.com/statsthinking21/statsthinking21-python"
