The guide covers:\n\n-   Creating a Google Form for data input.\n\n-   Embedding the form into a Quarto document.\n\n-   Retrieving and analyzing the collected responses in R.\n\nThis integration is particularly useful for educators and researchers seeking to gather user input directly from their Quarto-based content.\n\n1.

If you don't already have a workflow to edit files and sync to GitHub from your computer, I recommend RStudio. You don't need to know R to use RStudio, and it has powerful editor features that make for happy workflows.\n\n1.
