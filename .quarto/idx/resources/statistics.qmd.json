Ben-Shachar](https://shouldbewriting.netlify.app/posts/2020-08-11-when-predictors-covary/)\n\n**What is this?**\n\n**Excerpt from blog:** Co-varying predictors can be a messy business.\nThey make estimates unstable, reducing our statistical power and making interpretation more difficult.\nIn this post I will demonstrate how ignoring the presence of co-variation between predictors when exploring our models can lead to odd results and how we might deal with this issue.\n\n1.

them using R or not.\n\n## [**powerLATE**](https://github.com/kbansak/powerLATE):\n\nExcerpt from site: powerLATE implements the generalized power analysis for the local average treatment effect (LATE), proposed by Bansak (2020).\n\nPower analysis is in the context of estimating the LATE (also known as the complier average causal effect, or CACE), with calculations based on a test of the null hypothesis that the LATE equals 0 with a two-sided alternative.\nThe method uses standardized effect sizes to place a conservative bound on the power under minimal assumptions.\npowerLATE allows users to recover power, sample size requirements, or minimum detectable effect sizes.\nIt also allows users to work with absolute effects rather than effect sizes, to specify an additional assumption to narrow the bounds, and to incorporate covariate adjustment.\n\n## [**Simulation for Power Analysis by Nick Huntington-Klein**](https://nickch-k.github.io/EconometricsSlides/Week_08/Power_Simulations.html):\n\nExcerpt from site: In this document we'll talk about power analysis in general and how it's done, and then we'll go into how to perform a power analysis using simulation in R, making use of tools from the tidyverse.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"statistics.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
