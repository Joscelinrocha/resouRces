You\\'ll learn artistic techniques that generative artists use regularly in their work including flow fields, iterative function systems, and more. You\\'ll also learn about R packages specialised for generative art. But more than that, you\\'ll learn how to reuse skills you already have as part of an artistic process: with a little work, ggplot2, dplyr, and Rcpp can become an artist\\'s best friends. The assumed background is that you\\'re reasonably comfortable using R and RStudio, and have experience with tidyverse.\n\n1.  Link to site here: <https://art-from-code.netlify.app/>\n2.

Each month of 2019 I tackle a new generative/data art project. All of this work is done with R. Read more about it in my project intro blog post. There is a folder for each month that contains all of the code and art along with a readme to explain how to use the scripts. Each month also has an accompanying blog post which you can find below that explains the process and shows off many of the art pieces.\n\n1.

Each polygon, or Voronoi cell, contains an original point and all that are closer to that point than any other. This is a nice example of a Voronoi tesselation.\n\n1.
