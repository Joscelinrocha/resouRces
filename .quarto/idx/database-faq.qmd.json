I try my best to assign the resources in the categories I have listed but sometimes they are ambiguous. If I have time I put them in both categories but I usually don't.

I just would really appreciate it if you share it with your peers and especially BIPOC young people who otherwise cannot afford expensive courses to learn this skill.\\\nIf you would like to do something else you can <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cookie\" rel=\"stylesheet\"><a class=\"bmc-button\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/JoscelinRocha\"><img src=\"https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/bmc-new-btn-logo.svg\" alt=\"Buy me a coffee\"/>Buy me a Coffee</a> or Venmo me at @JoscelinRocha\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cookie\" rel=\"stylesheet\"><a class=\"bmc-button\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/JoscelinRocha\">![Buy me a coffee](https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/bmc-new-btn-logo.svg){alt=\"Buy me a coffee\" width=\"15\" height=\"21\"}Buy me a coffee</a>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**How do I keep up to date with any changes?**\\\nPlease note that this is a work in progress, I add resources every week or as often as I find resources.\n\nRemember to check back in regularly to get any updates.
