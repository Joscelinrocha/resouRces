That's OK --- the goal here is not to teach programming1. The goal is to teach you just enough R to be confident to explore your data.\n\nThis book uses R like any other statistics software: To work-with and visualize data, run statistical analyses, and share our results with others. To do that you don't need more than the absolute basics of the R language itself.\n\n1.

It would be suitable for anyone who has had some stats training but not used R; or has used R a little but not become confident; or has neither had stats training nor used R but is not happy with a reasonably steep learning curve. The emphasis is on rapidly getting to be able to use R for most of the common practical purposes, and knowing that you can take it further should you need to. It is designed for you to be able to work through on your own.\n\n1.  Link to pdf for intro: <https://www.danielnettle.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/funwithR3.0.pdf>\n2.
