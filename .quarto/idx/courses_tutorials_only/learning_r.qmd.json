In order to teach that, we must teach people a little about the mechanics of manipulating data with lists and file I/O so that their functions can do things they actually care about. Our teaching order tries to show practical uses of every idea as soon as it is introduced; instructors should resist the temptation to explain the \"other 90%\" of the language as well.\n\n1.

Have you been wondering how R can make your analysis easier and your research reproducible? We present a practical introduction to R, demonstrating core analyses in psychology research (e.g., ANOVA, regression). We also explain how to manipulate and clean data in R to maintain a precise record of how the data went from raw to analysis-ready. The ideal audience for this workshop is a researcher who has not used R before, has used it briefly and then gone back to SPSS for the final analyses, or who has used R a few times but wants a better grounding in the basics.\n\n1.

In order to teach that, we must teach people a little about the mechanics of manipulating data with lists and file I/O so that their functions can do things they actually care about. Our teaching order tries to show practical uses of every idea as soon as it is introduced; instructors should resist the temptation to explain the \"other 90%\" of the language as well.\n\n1.
