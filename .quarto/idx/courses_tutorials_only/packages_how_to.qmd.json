This tutorial is about creating a bare-minimum R package so that you don't have to keep thinking to yourself, \"I really should just make an R package with these functions so I don't have to keep copy/pasting them like a goddamn luddite.\" Seriously, it doesn't have to be about sharing your code (although that is an added benefit!). It is about saving yourself time.
