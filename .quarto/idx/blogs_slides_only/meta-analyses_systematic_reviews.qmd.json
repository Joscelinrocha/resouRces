The\naudience of the original workshop were graduate psychology students at\nthe University of Vienna with a focus on research methods. Most\nstatistical and methodical elements were already discussed, yet the\nimplementation in R was new to all of them. And programming in general\nwas new to most of them. I therefore introduced R very shortly, before\nexplaining the actual meta-analytical analyses more briefly. I added\nsome explanations and references to make the file more self-explanatory\nfor independent study. Therefore, this post also contains materials and\nreferences on how to install R, R Studio, and some basic concepts of\nprogramming.\n\n1.
