The book takes you from installing R to practicing more advanced data science skills like text analysis.\n\nIf you've never written a line of R code, we welcome you to the community! We wrote this book for you. Consider reading the book cover to cover and doing all the analysis walkthroughs. Remember that you'll get more from a few minutes of practice every day than you will from long hours of practice every once in awhile. Typing code every day, even if it doesn't always run, is a daily practice that invites learning and \"a-ha\" moments.\n\n1.
