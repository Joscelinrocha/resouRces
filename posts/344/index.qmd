**What is this?**

The **ggplot_theme_Publication** repository offers three custom themes and new color palettes for **ggplot2**, aiming to create clean and simple graphics suitable for publication.
These themes address common aesthetic concerns such as plot background, title and axis label fonts and sizes, axis appearance, tick marks, colors, and legend positioning.
By applying these themes, users can enhance the visual appeal and readability of their plots, making them more suitable for inclusion in academic and professional publications.
