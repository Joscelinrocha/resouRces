## [ggplot Wizardry: My Favorite Tricks and Secrets for Beautiful Plots in R](https://github.com/Z3tt/OutlierConf2021/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** In this talk, I present my favorite tips and tricks with regard to the ggplot2 package, a library for plotting in the programming language R.
I will cover functions that are helpful but many may not be aware of as well as a collection of interesting functions from a large range of extension packages.
The talk is intended for people who already know how to code in R and ggplot2.
However, I am going to cover a diverse collection of tips so I hope everyone can pick something helpful independent from their level of expertise.
