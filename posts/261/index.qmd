## [Check how good your model is using "Performance"package]()

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** Utilities for computing measures to assess model quality, which are not directly provided by R's 'base' or 'stats' packages.
These include e.g. measures like r-squared, intraclass correlation coefficient (Nakagawa, Johnson & Schielzeth (2017) <doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0213>), root mean squared error or functions to check models for overdispersion, singularity or zero-inflation and more.
Functions apply to a large variety of regression models, including generalized linear models, mixed effects models and Bayesian models.
