**What is this?**

**Excerpt from the video:** This short video clip shows you how to synchronize your bibliographic data from [#CiteDrive](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/citedrive) directly in your [#RMarkdown](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/rmarkdown) project.
Every time you or a member of your team add a new reference or change or delete an old one, "knit" updates the current status from your CiteDrive project directly in your R Markdown document.
