This course teaches how to use the shinydashboard R package. To get the most out of this course, open an R Session and follow the lessons. In each lesson you will see the shell of some code to copy into your R Session and edit to complete the tasks. At the end of each chapter is an application with the full solutions. By the end you should be able to build a simple dynamic dashboard!
