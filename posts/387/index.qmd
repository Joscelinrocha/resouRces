**What is this?**

This repository features an R-based maze generator that employs a random walk algorithm to create mazes of customizable sizes.
It offers visualization capabilities for both static mazes and animated generation processes, allowing users to observe the maze construction step by step.
The project includes functions to adjust wall thickness, path appearance, and options to display node numbers and path progression.
Additionally, it provides export features for both static images and animated mazes.
