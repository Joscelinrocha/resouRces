## [Introduction to Empirical Bayes: Examples from Baseball Statistics](https://gumroad.com/l/empirical-bayes)

By [David Robinson](https://gumroad.com/l/empirical-bayes)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from ebook:** This book is adapted from a series of ten posts on my blog, starting with Understanding the beta distribution and ending recently with Simulation of empirical Bayesian methods.
In these posts I've introduced the empirical Bayesian approach to estimation, credible intervals, A/B testing, mixture models, and other methods, all through the example of baseball batting averages.
