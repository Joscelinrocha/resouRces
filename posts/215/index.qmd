## [Visualization of MRI data in R](https://www.alexejgossmann.com/MRI_viz/)

Added Sunday Dec 13th, 2020

**What is this?**

**Description from site:** In this blog post I present some functions
which I was able to find for MRI visualization in R, and which I found
to be very useful. All functions presented below presuppose an image in
the NIfTI data format as input, and are very user-friendly.

Uses the ***oro.nifti*** package
