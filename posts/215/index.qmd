The scans reveal structural brain details with clear contrast between gray and white matter."

**Description from site:** In this blog post I present some functions which I was able to find for MRI visualization in R, and which I found to be very useful. All functions presented below presuppose an image in the NIfTI data format as input, and are very user-friendly.

Uses the ***oro.nifti*** package
