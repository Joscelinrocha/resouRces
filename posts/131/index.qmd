## [Hands-On Programming](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)

By [R Garrett Grolemund](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This is the website for "Hands-On Programming with R". This book will teach you how to program in R, with hands-on examples. I wrote it for non-programmers to provide a friendly introduction to the R language. You'll learn how to load data, assemble and disassemble data objects, navigate R's environment system, write your own functions, and use all of R's programming tools.
