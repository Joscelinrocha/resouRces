**Excerpt from blog:** Co-varying predictors can be a messy business. They make estimates unstable, reducing our statistical power and making interpretation more difficult. In this post I will demonstrate how ignoring the presence of co-variation between predictors when exploring our models can lead to odd results and how we might deal with this issue.
