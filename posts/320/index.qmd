**What is it?**

**Excerpt from site:** This is a crowd-sourced list of uses of R to teach research methods in Psychology, and a link to Creative Commons teaching materials, where these are available.
The year teaching in R was adopted at undergraduate and postgraduate level is also recorded, where known.
Where there are no materials, but the organization's name has a link, this is a link to evidence that R is used.
