## [Programming with R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)

By [The Carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This lesson is written as an introduction to R, but its real purpose is to introduce the single most important idea in programming: how to solve problems by building functions, each of which can fit in a programmer's working memory. In order to teach that, we must teach people a little about the mechanics of manipulating data with lists and file I/O so that their functions can do things they actually care about. Our teaching order tries to show practical uses of every idea as soon as it is introduced; instructors should resist the temptation to explain the "other 90%" of the language as well.
