## [First steps in spatial handling and visualization](https://github.com/statnmap/user2020_rspatial_tutorial)

By [SÃ©bastien Rochette, Dorris Scott, & Jakub Nowosad](https://github.com/statnmap/user2020_rspatial_tutorial)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from tutorial:** The tutorial is designed for R users from a variety of fields who are interested in working with spatial data and creating maps with R.
No knowledge of cartography is required.
Prior knowledge of (non-spatial) graphic making and data handling with the {tidyverse} in R is recommended.
