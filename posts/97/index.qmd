Added Thu Feb 20, 2025

**What is this?**

The **acadyr** package provides utility functions for creating and
working with financial and academic years in R. It addresses challenges
associated with non-calendar year types, such as differing start dates
and formatting complexities. The package allows users to define
financial or academic years with customizable start dates, facilitating
seamless integration into data analysis workflows. Additionally,
**acadyr** ensures compatibility with visualization tools like
**ggplot2**, enabling clear and accurate representation of data
categorized by these non-standard years.
