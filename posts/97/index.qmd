The **acadyr** package provides utility functions for creating and working with financial and academic years in R. It addresses challenges associated with non-calendar year types, such as differing start dates and formatting complexities. The package allows users to define financial or academic years with customizable start dates, facilitating seamless integration into data analysis workflows. Additionally, **acadyr** ensures compatibility with visualization tools like **ggplot2**, enabling clear and accurate representation of data categorized by these non-standard years.
