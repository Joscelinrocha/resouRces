**Excerpt from blog:** I’ve written before, I am at best an enthusiastic amateur when it comes to AI, LLMs and R. But I’m braver/dumber than most, so for a talk I’m giving to NE-RUG – the Nebraska R Users Group – and to the NICAR data journalism conference, I’ve got some resources and some code to share.
