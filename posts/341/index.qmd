**What is this?**

**Excerpt from blog:** A ggalluvial plot, also known as an alluvial diagram, is a [type of visualization](https://pyoflife.com/learn-data-visualization-with-r-pdf/) used to show how categorical data is distributed among different groups.
It is particularly useful for visualizing how categorical variables are related to each other across different levels of a grouping variable.
