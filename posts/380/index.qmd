## [Introducing {ggflowchart}](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/introducing-ggflowchart/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site**: Flowcharts can be a useful way to visualise complex processes, and the new R package {ggflowchart} makes them easy to create in R.
This blog post shows you how.
Back in April 2022, I participated in the [#30DayChartChallenge](https://twitter.com/30DayChartChall) and for the *Storytelling* prompt on day 29 in the *Uncertainty* category, I created the **Goldilocks Decision Tree**.
I also gave a talk to [R-Ladies Nairobi](https://twitter.com/RLadiesNairobi) on the challenge and used the flowchart as a live-coding example.
A summary of the talk ended up as a [blog post](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/2022-06-06-creating-flowcharts-with-ggplot2/).
