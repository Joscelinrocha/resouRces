**Excerpt from site:** This is a series of labs/tutorials currently under development (2020-2021) for a two-semester graduate-level statistics sequence in Psychology \@ Brooklyn College of CUNY. The goal of these tutorials is to 1) develop a deeper conceptual understanding of the principles of statistical analysis and inference; and 2) develop practical skills for data-analysis, such as using the increasingly popular statistical software environment R to code reproducible analyses.
