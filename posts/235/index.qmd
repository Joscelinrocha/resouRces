## [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)ðŸ’¯ ðŸ’¯

By [Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux, Emily

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from ebook:** This book aims to draw together
popular posts from Stack Overflow and other online resources
(such as blog posts or tutorials) to provide up-to-date
solutions for everyday queries that users commonly make. In
fact, to help us make decisions on the potential topics to
cover in this book, the second author of this book,
Christophe, has built an R Markdown dashboard to scrape
Stack Overflow daily for the most popular posts. Hopefully,
our cookbook can become more useful by including recipes
from these popular posts.
