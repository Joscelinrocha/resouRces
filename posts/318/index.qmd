## [rstudio4edu A Handbook for Teaching and Learning with R and RStudio](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/)

By [Desir√©e De Leon & Alison Hill](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/)

**What is it?**

**Excerpt from handbook:** This handbook was inspired by the Handbook for Teaching and Learning with Jupyter- a book written by and for educators who teach data science.
It is a thoughtful and inspiring resource for all educators, with a focus on the Python ecosystem.
We aimed to create a similar resource for educators working with the R and RStudio ecosystem.
