## [Methods for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging ('qMRI')](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/qMRI/index.html)

Added Sunday Dec 13th, 2020**What is this?**

Description from site: Implementation of methods for estimation of
quantitative maps from Multi-Parameter Mapping (MPM) acquisitions
(Weiskopf et al. (2013) ) including adaptive smoothing methods in the
framework of the ESTATICS model (Estimating the apparent transverse
relaxation time (R2\*) from images with different contrasts, Weiskopf et
al. (2014) ). The smoothing method is described in Mohammadi et al.
(2017). . Usage of the package is also described in Polzehl and Tabelow
(2019), Magnetic Resonance Brain Imaging, Chapter 6, Springer, Use R!
Series.
