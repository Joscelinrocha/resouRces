Description from site: Implementation of methods for estimation of quantitative maps from Multi-Parameter Mapping (MPM) acquisitions (Weiskopf et al. (2013) ) including adaptive smoothing methods in the framework of the ESTATICS model (Estimating the apparent transverse relaxation time (R2\*) from images with different contrasts, Weiskopf et al. (2014) ). The smoothing method is described in Mohammadi et al. (2017). . Usage of the package is also described in Polzehl and Tabelow (2019), Magnetic Resonance Brain Imaging, Chapter 6, Springer, Use R! Series.
