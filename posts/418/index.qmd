## [A Blogdown New Post Workflow with Github and Netlify](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/blogdown-netlify-new-post-workflow/)

By [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/blogdown-netlify-new-post-workflow/)

**Excerpt from blog:** This post presents my workflow for writing new posts for a blogdown website hosted on GitHub and served through Netlify.

Here's a quick overview of the workflow:

-   Draft the post in a new git branch, using blogdown::serve_site() to preview locally.

-   Push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request.

-   Preview and test the draft post using Netlify's "deploy preview" feature.

-   Push additional updates to the post branch as needed and review the updated preview.

-   Publish the final draft by merging the pull request to the master branch.
