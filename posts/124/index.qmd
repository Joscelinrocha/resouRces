**Excerpt from ebook:** This book is for anyone who wants to make their R code faster to type, faster to run and more scalable. These considerations generally come after learning the very basics of R for data analysis: we assume you are either accustomed to R or proficient at programming in other languages, although this book could still be of use to beginners
