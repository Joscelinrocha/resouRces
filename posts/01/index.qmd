**Excerpt from site:** This workshop provides a hands-on introduction to generative art in R. You'll learn artistic techniques that generative artists use regularly in their work including flow fields, iterative function systems, and more. You'll also learn about R packages specialised for generative art. But more than that, you'll learn how to reuse skills you already have as part of an artistic process: with a little work, ggplot2, dplyr, and Rcpp can become an artist's best friends. The assumed background is that you're reasonably comfortable using R and RStudio, and have experience with tidyverse.
