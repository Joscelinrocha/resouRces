**Excerpt from blog:** This tutorial is not about making a beautiful, perfect R package. This tutorial is about creating a bare-minimum R package so that you don't have to keep thinking to yourself, "I really should just make an R package with these functions so I don't have to keep copy/pasting them like a goddamn luddite." Seriously, it doesn't have to be about sharing your code (although that is an added benefit!). It is about saving yourself time. (n.b. this is my attitude about all reproducibility)
