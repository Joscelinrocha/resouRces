**What is this?**

**Excerpt from channel:** TidyX is a screen cast where we select a person's code from the TidyTuesday project and go through their code line-by-line, explaining what they did and how the functions they used work.
We also break down the visualizations they create and talk about how to apply similar approaches to other data sets.
The objective is to help more people learn R and get involved in the TidyTuesday community.
