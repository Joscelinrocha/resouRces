Added Sat Dec, 2021.**What is this?****Excerpt from site:** "I've created two tutorials in learnr, one that is a true introduction for beginners (focused on the tidyverse) and one that goes a little bit deeper into data manipuation with pivoting and joining data. These tutorials (screenshot below) live in a package I created called betweenthepipes".
