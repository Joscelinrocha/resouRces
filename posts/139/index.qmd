**Excerpt from site:** In this 90-minute workshop targeted to beginner and intermediate R users, weâ€™ll go through a sample hockey analysis question and discuss techniques from the `tidyverse` and beyond (including user-defined functions, RMarkdown, custom `ggplot2` themes, and data manipulation with `tidyr` and `dplyr`) to learn how to level up your R programming and make your analysis more efficient and more reproducible.
