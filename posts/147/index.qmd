**Excerpt from the course:** The R-Bootcamp is a gentle and gradual introduction to manipulating and visualizing data in R using the `tidyverse` suite of packages. It is meant for incoming OHSU Bioinformatics and Computational Biomedicine Majors but is appropriate for any beginners wanting to learn elementary data manipulation in R.
