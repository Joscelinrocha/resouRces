## [ggsignif: Significance Brackets for 'ggplot2'](https://github.com/const-ae/ggsignif)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** "This package provides an easy way to indicate if two groups are significantly different. Commonly this is shown by a bar on top connecting the groups of interest which itself is annotated with the level of significance (NS, *, **,*** ). The package provides a single layer (geom_signif) that takes the groups for comparison and the test (t.test, wilcox etc.) and adds the annotation to the plot".
