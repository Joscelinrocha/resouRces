**Excerpt from ebook:** This short book introduces an R
package, bookdown, to change your workflow of writing books.
It should be technically easy to write a book, visually
pleasant to view the book, fun to interact with the book,
convenient to navigate through the book, straightforward for
readers to contribute or leave feedback to the book
author(s), and more importantly, authors should not always
be distracted by typesetting details.
