**Description from site:** This package mainly contains a plotting function *ggseg* and data.frames of different brain atlases for plotting. Plotting results of analyses on regions or networks often involves swapping between statistical tools, like R, and software for brain imaging to correctly visualize analysis results.

This package aims to make it possible to plot results directly through R.
