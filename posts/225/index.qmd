## [ggsegExtra](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggsegExtra)

Added Sunday Dec 13th, 2020**What is this?**

**Description from site:** This package mainly contains a plotting
function ggseg and data.frames of different brain atlases for plotting.
Plotting results of analyses on regions or networks often involves
swapping between statistical tools, like R, and software for brain
imaging to correctly visualize analysis results.

This package aims to make it possible to plot results directly through
R.
