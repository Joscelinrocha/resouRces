## [The grobblR package to make graph for PDF docs](https://github.com/calvinmfloyd/grobblR)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from read.me:** The grobblR package allows R users the ability to intuitively create flexible, reproducible PDF reports comprised of aesthetically pleasing tables, images, plots and/or text.
This is done by implementing grobs from the grid and gridExtra packages.
