**Excerpt from site:** The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) program includes four longitudinal studies that examine child development, school readiness, and early school experiences from birth through elementary school. The program provides data to analyze the relationships among a wide range of family, school, community, and individual factors with children's development, early learning, and performance in school.
