By [Hadley Wickham](https://r-pkgs.org/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book:** Writing a package can seem overwhelming at first. So start with the basics and improve it over time. It doesn't matter if your first version isn't perfect as long as the next version is better.

This is the work-in-progress 2nd edition of the book.
