## [Package eegUtils](https://neuroconductor.org/help/eegUtils/)

Added Sunday Dec 13th, 2020

**What is this?**

**Description from site:** A collection of functions for EEG processing.
Includes import functions for Biosemi (BDF) and Neuroscan (CNT),
topographical plotting, referencing, and epoching. eegUtils is a package
for the processing, manipulation, and plotting of EEG data. It includes
functions for importing data from a variety of file formats (including
Biosemi, Brain Vision Analyzer, and EEGLAB), many of the typical steps
in pre-preprocessing (filtering, referencing, artefact rejection), more
advanced processing techniques (time-frequency analysis, ICA), and many
types of plot that are common in the field (ERP plots, time-frequency
plots, topographical scalp maps). Although it uses custom object
classes, it is designed such that these are always translatable to
standard R data.frames, and thus can be used with any of the myriad
packages and methods that support standard R formats.
