image-alt: "A line plot showing EEG amplitude (in microvolts, µV) over time (in seconds) for multiple electrodes. Each colored line represents a different electrode (labeled A13, A21, A29, A31, A5, B16, B18, B26, B5, B6, B8) with varying waveform patterns. Vertical and horizontal black lines mark time zero and amplitude zero, respectively, indicating stimulus onset."

**Description from site:** A collection of functions for EEG processing. Includes import functions for Biosemi (BDF) and Neuroscan (CNT), topographical plotting, referencing, and epoching. eegUtils is a package for the processing, manipulation, and plotting of EEG data. It includes functions for importing data from a variety of file formats (including Biosemi, Brain Vision Analyzer, and EEGLAB), many of the typical steps in pre-preprocessing (filtering, referencing, artefact rejection), more advanced processing techniques (time-frequency analysis, ICA), and many types of plot that are common in the field (ERP plots, time-frequency plots, topographical scalp maps). Although it uses custom object classes, it is designed such that these are always translatable to standard R data.frames, and thus can be used with any of the myriad packages and methods that support standard R formats.
