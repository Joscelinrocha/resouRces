**Excerpt from ebook:** This chapter presented Spark as a modern and powerful computing platform, R as an easy-to-use computing language with solid foundations in statistical methods, and sparklyr as a project bridging both technologies and communities. In a world in which the total amount of information is growing exponentially, learning how to analyze data at scale will help you to tackle the problems and opportunities humanity is facing today. However, before we start analyzing data, Chapter 2 will equip you with the tools you will need throughout the rest of this book. Be sure to follow each step carefully and take the time to install the recommended tools, which we hope will become familiar resources that you use and love.
