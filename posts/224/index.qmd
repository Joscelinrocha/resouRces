**Description from site:** Plotting regions from different brain atlases ggplot2 is a handy way of displaying results or grouping of aparc data.

The function ggseg(), is based in the ggplot2 format, it is recommended to get familiarized with plotting data with ggplot2.

Out-of-the-box, ggseg() works without supplying any extra information. It will create a base plot of the aparc brain segmentations.
