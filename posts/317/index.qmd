**Excerpt from website:** *A data project often actually starts with a part than might present some frustration: data cleaning, manipulation, and management. Sometimes this is called “data wrangling” because of the possible struggles that arise in getting your data ready for data visualization and analysis. But wrangling can be satisfying. You might find yourself liking it!*
