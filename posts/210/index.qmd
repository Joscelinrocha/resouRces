## [erzk/fnirsr: Package for analysing funtional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data](https://rdrr.io/github/erzk/fnirsr/#vignettes)

Added Sunday Dec 13th, 2020**What is this?**

**Description from site:** Load, slice, filter, plot, and transform
fNIRS data. The majority of functions were developed to work with
Hitachi ETG-4000 data.

Link to repo here: https://github.com/erzk/fnirsr

Cool functions from package:

1.  **load_ETG4000_data()**: Loading the signal from csv files
2.  **plot_ETG4000()**: Plotting function with "facets" as default.
3.  **remove_channels_ETG4000()**: If a channel (or several channels) is
    corrupt and cannot be cleaned then the simplest way to obtain clean
    grand average is to remove the noisy channel.
4.  **detrend_ETG4000_data()**: fNIRS signal is likely to show a linear
    trend which can be removed. Grand Average in the plot above is
    showing a linear downward trend. The linear trend can be removed
    from all channels (recommended) or from a single channel.
