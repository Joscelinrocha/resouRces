## [The Evolution of a ggplot (Ep. 1)](https://cedricscherer.netlify.app/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from the blog:** In this series of blog posts, I aim to show you how to turn a default ggplot into a plot that visualizes information in an appealing and easily understandable way.
The goal of each blog post is to provide a step-by-step tutorial explaining how my visualization have evolved from a typical basic ggplot.
All plots are going to be created with 100% {ggplot2} and 0% Inkscape.
