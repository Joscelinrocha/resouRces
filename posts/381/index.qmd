## [Introduction to rbokeh--a vignette](https://hafen.github.io/rbokeh/articles/rbokeh.html)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from vignette:** Bokeh is a visualization library that provides a flexible and powerful declarative framework for creating web-based plots.
Bokeh renders plots using HTML canvas and provides many mechanisms for interactivity.
Bokeh has interfaces in Python, Scala, Julia, and now R.
The Bokeh library is written and maintained by the Bokeh Core Team consisting of several members of Continuum Analytics and other members of the open source community.
The rbokeh package is written and maintained by Ryan Hafen (@hafenstats) with several contributions from others.
