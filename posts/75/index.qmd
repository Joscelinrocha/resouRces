**Excerpt from repo:** This repository contains a Jupyter notebook file which walks you through the basics of using notebooks and RStats for reproducible data analysis. It starts with a general guide to the notebook format and how to install the necessary software. Then it goes through an example using R to load data, filter missing values, create graphs and run statistical tests.
