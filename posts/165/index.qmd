**Excerpt from site:** In this tutorial, I'll walk through how to go from a database or tabular data file to an interactive plot with surprisingly little pain (and less code than you'd imagine). My focus will be on introducing a workflow that uses a wide variety of different tools and packages, including readr, dplyr, tidyr, and shiny. I'll assume basic familiarity with R and will use (but not spend too much time teaching) ggplot2. Featuring data from http://wordbank.stanford.edu
