**What is this?**

**ggreveal** is an R package that enables the incremental presentation of **ggplot2** graphs.
It allows users to break down a plot into a series of intermediary plots, which can be displayed sequentially, making it particularly useful for teaching and presentations.
The package offers functions such as `reveal_groups()`, `reveal_layers()`, and `reveal_aes()` to incrementally reveal different aspects of a plot.
