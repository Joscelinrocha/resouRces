**What is this?**

This article explores the distribution of households in the United States that own four or more vehicles.
Utilizing data from the American Community Survey, the author presents maps and analyses to identify regions with high concentrations of such households.
The study provides insights into transportation patterns, urban planning, and the socio-economic factors influencing vehicle ownership across different areas.
This is great for visualization examples (code is within the blog).
