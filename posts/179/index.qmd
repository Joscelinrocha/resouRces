**What is this?**

**Excerpt from blog:** This is a 1-hour tutorial that can be used to
teach or as self-paced learning.

We introduce Quarto by exploring this tutorial website, and practicing
the basic Quarto workflow using different tools (GitHub browser,
RStudio, and Jupyter) for editing your website.

We'll start off from the browser so you don't need to install any
additional software, however this approach is very limited and you will
soon outgrow its capabilities. If you don't already have a workflow to
edit files and sync to GitHub from your computer, I recommend RStudio.
You don't need to know R to use RStudio, and it has powerful editor
features that make for happy workflows.
