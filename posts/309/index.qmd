## [Test your model!! Performance package](https://easystats.github.io/performance/index.html)

**What is this?**

Test if your model is a good model!
The primary goal of the performance package is to provide utilities for computing indices of model quality and goodness of fit.
This includes measures like r-squared (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE) or intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), but also functions to check (mixed) models for overdispersion, zero-inflation, convergence or singularity.
