**Excerpt from blog:** One of the best parts about the functions in the [`dplyr` package](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/e5uv8dzv9wf0uzpgz8i8h8rgp222cl/owhkhqhrv3g73rbv/aHR0cHM6Ly9kcGx5ci50aWR5dmVyc2Uub3JnLw==) (one of several that make up the `tidyverse` collection of packages) is that their names indicate what they do. No need to remember a weird acronym; the name of the function to filter your data is `filter()`. But, helpful as these function names are, it can still be hard to remember exactly what the functions do...I've collected all of these animations in one place (and added some sample code to show how they work). If you're just learning R and want a visual aid to help you, check it out! If you've already mastered these functions, consider sharing them with a friend.
