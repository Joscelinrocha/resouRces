Each plot contains a black 45-degree line representing perfect prediction and a red smoothed curve indicating the trend of actual data points. Points are scattered along the line with some deviation. The plots vary in aspect ratio, but all show general agreement between predicted and observed values, with some nonlinear patterns captured by the red line."
