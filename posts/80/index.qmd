## [forcatspart of the tidyverse](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** R uses factors to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values.
Factors are also helpful for reordering character vectors to improve display.
The goal of the forcats package is to provide a suite of tools that solve common problems with factors, including changing the order of levels or the values.
