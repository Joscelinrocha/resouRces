## [Statistical rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse: Second edition by Solomon Kurz](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book:** This ebook is based on the second edition of Richard McElreath's (2020a) text, Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan.
My contributions show how to fit the models he covered with Paul Bürkner's brms package (Bürkner, 2017, 2018, 2020c), which makes it easy to fit Bayesian regression models in R (R Core Team, 2020) using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
I also prefer plotting and data wrangling with the packages from the tidyverse (Wickham, 2019; Wickham et al., 2019).
So we'll be using those methods, too.
