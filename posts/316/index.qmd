**Excerpt from blog:** This blog post contains a written version of my speaker notes for my 20-minute 2020 NYC R conference talk. Since the talk time is on the shorter side, I trimmed a few things out of the talk that I would have liked to include with more time. The speaker notes for the unabridged version are included here for your reference.
