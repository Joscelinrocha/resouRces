## [How to prepare and teach an R lesson](https://www.monicathieu.com/posts/2020-08-15-prepare-teach-r-lesson/)

**What is it?**

**Excerpt from blog:** This blog post contains a written version of my speaker notes for my 20-minute 2020 NYC R conference talk.
Since the talk time is on the shorter side, I trimmed a few things out of the talk that I would have liked to include with more time.
The speaker notes for the unabridged version are included here for your reference.
