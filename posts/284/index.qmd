**What is this?**

**Excerpt from course:** This website has all the materials I use for teaching research methods within the Psychology major at Pitt.
I'm making these materials public, and calling this project Open Source Research Methods for the Social Sciences (osRMss).
I hope that you find the content useful.
I look forward to getting feedback and suggestions and to continually improve osRMss over time.
