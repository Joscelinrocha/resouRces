**What is this?**

**Excerpt from course site:** This is the web page for the Bayesian Data Analysis course at Aalto (CS-E5710) by Aki Vehtari.

Aalto students should check [the 2024 specific course web page](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/Aalto2024.html) and [MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=44799). **In 2024** Aalto course can be taken online except for the final project presentation. The lectures will be given on campus, but recorded and the recording will be made available online after the course. The registration for the course lectures will be used to estimate the need for the resources. If you are unable to register for the course at the moment in the Sisu, there is no need to email the lecturer. You can start taking the course and register before the end of the course. Sisu shows rooms on campus for the computer exercises, but you can join the TA sessions also online via Zulip and Zoom. You can choose which TA session to join each week separately, without a need to register for those sessions.
