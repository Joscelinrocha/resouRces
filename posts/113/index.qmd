## [A gentle crash course in R using tidyverse](https://osf.io/69gub/) ðŸŒ±

By: Nicholas M. Michalak & Loek Brinkman

**What is this?**

**Description from site:** In this three-hour workshop, we introduce you to data science in the R programming language. In particular, we'll show you how to use the "tidyverse" package to transform, visualize and model data. The workshop consists of short introductory presentations followed by elaborate hands-on sessions. At the end of each section, we'll showcase more complex features and functionality. The workshop is designed as an introduction to R. Zero programming experience is required. By the end of the workshop, you'll have a "feel" for what R is and what it can do for you, and we'll provide resources for follow-up self-study.
