**Description from site:** This is a repository containing the course notes and worked examples for a six week course in the R statistical programming language taught at the University of Melbourne, Australia. It is targeted at graduate students and faculty in psychology (and probably other social sciences) with no programming experience, and covers the use of R from the basics up to multilevel modelling, though it is not exhaustive within that range.
