The **crimedatasets** package offers a comprehensive collection of datasets focused on crimes, criminal activities, and related topics. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers, analysts, and students interested in crime analysis, criminology, and socio-economic studies related to criminal behavior. The package includes datasets spanning global and local contexts, available in various structures such as tibbles, data frames, tables, and spatial data (simple features).
