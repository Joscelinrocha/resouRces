By [Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim. Foreword by Kelly S. McConville](https://moderndive.com/v2/)

**Excerpt from ebook:** Over the course of this book, you will develop your "data science toolbox," equipping yourself with tools such as data visualization, data formatting, data wrangling, and data modeling using regression.

In particular, this book will lean heavily on data visualization. In today's world, we are bombarded with graphics that attempt to convey ideas. We will explore what makes a good graphic and what the standard ways are used to convey relationships within data. In general, we'll use visualization as a way of building almost all of the ideas in this book.
