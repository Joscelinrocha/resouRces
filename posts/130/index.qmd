**Excerpt from repo:** An eight-page pdf guide for "Getting Started in R". Objective: To create a short guide that gives a quick overview and introduction to R.\
\
The **tinyplot** package aims to remove this overhead. It provides a lightweight extension of the base R graphics system that preserves the same core logic and syntax, but with numerous convenience features to make base R plotting a more user-friendly experience. For example, the core `tinyplot()` function—or its shorthand alias `plt()`—makes it easy to plot grouped datasets and generate automatic legends in a single function call. Or, you can display groups in separate facets without having to worry about manually setting plot regions. While **tinyplot** offers these and various other enhancements, it tries as far as possible to be a drop-in replacement for the equivalent base plotting function. Users should generally be able to swap out a valid `plot()` call for `tinyplot()`/`plt()` without any changes to the expected output.
