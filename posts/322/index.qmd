**What is this?**

This repository showcases Steven Ponce’s participation in the annual #30DayChartChallenge, a community-driven data visualization event held every April.
Each day features a prompt across five key categories: comparisons, distributions, relationships, time series, and uncertainties.
Steven's contributions include R scripts and visualizations for each prompt, organized into folders for the 2024 and 2025 challenges.
The repository also contains a `summary` folder, fonts, and a `renv` environment for reproducibility.​
