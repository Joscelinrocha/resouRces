**Excerpt from site:** This is a graduate economics seminar taught by Grant McDermott at the University of Oregon.

Please read the syllabus before you go through any of the lectures. This will detail software requirements and installation, and give you a better sense of the aims and scope of the course. I also have an "FAQ" section at the end that covers frequently asked questions (or, at least, potentially asked questions). Speaking of which, here follow answers to some questions that are more specifically related to this repo.
