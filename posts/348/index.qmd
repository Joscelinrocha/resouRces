## [Data visualisation using R, for researchers who don't use R](https://psyteachr.github.io/introdataviz/)ðŸ’¯

Added Fri Feb 18th, 2022

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to data visualisation using R, specifically aimed at researchers who have little to no prior experience of using R.
First we detail the rationale for using R for data visualisation and introduce the "grammar of graphics" that underlies data visualisation using the ggplot2 package.
The tutorial then walks the reader through how to replicate plots that are commonly available in point-and-click software such as histograms and boxplots, as well as showing how the code for these "basic" plots can be easily extended to less commonly available options such as violin-boxplots.
