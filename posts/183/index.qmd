The deployment process includes hashing 620 files, CDN diffing and uploading 4 files, and confirming the deployment is live. It provides a draft URL and log URL, with a note to use --prod flag for full deployment.'

**Excerpt from blog:** What we want is Github Actions to run certain operations on a set schedule, build our website with hugo, and then trigger a Netlify deployment. In particular, we want to render the content/about.Rmd and knit my CV which is located in content/about/resume/am_mowinckel_cv.Rmd, and not commit these to git, just have them rendered right before Hugo build
