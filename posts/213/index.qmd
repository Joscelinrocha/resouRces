## [freesurferformats: R Package For Reading and Writing Neuroimaging File Formats](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/freesurferformats)

Added Sunday Dec 13th, 2020

**What is this?**

**Description from site:** The 'freesurferformats' package is an R
library for reading and writing neuroimaging file formats. The focus is
on structural MRI file formats from the FreeSurfer brain imaging
software suite, but a range of other file formats are supported as well.
The package can be used to read 3D and 4D volume files (brain models,
segemntations, voxel-wise results), 2D surface-based morphometry data
(e.g., cortical thickness maps), brain surface meshes, atlas-based
parcellations and labels, surface patches, and spatial transformation
matrices in various file formats. The vast majority of formats can also
be written. The related 'fsbrain' package can be used to visualize
neuroimaging data directly in R.
