**Excerpt from course:** The goal of this course is to give you the skills to do the statistics that are in current published papers, and make pretty figures to show off your results. While we will go over the mathematical concepts behind the statistics, this is NOT meant to be a classical statistics class. We will focus more on making the connection between the mathematical equation and the R code, and what types of variables fit into each slot of the equation.
