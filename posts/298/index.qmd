**Excerpt from book:** The content in this “book”, as the title suggests, is related to statistical modeling and computation. More specifically, the content focuses on using the General Linear Model (GLM) to provide statistical evidence that can help answer substantive questions in the educational and social sciences. It is a book intended for applied practitioners in the educational or social sciences. The statistical content is hopefully presented in a manner that these domain scientists will find useful, including practical suggestions for analysis and the presentation of results intended to help researchers clearly communicate the results of a data analysis.
