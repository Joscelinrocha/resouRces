**Excerpt from site here:** Use Large Language Models (LLM) to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) operations against your data. It takes advantage of the LLMs general language training in order to get the predictions, thus removing the need to train a new NLP model. `mall` is available for R and Python.

It works by running multiple LLM predictions against your data. The predictions are processed row-wise over a specified column. It relies on the “one-shot” prompt technique to instruct the LLM on a particular NLP operation to perform. The package includes prompts to perform the following specific NLP operations:

-   [Sentiment analysis](https://mlverse.github.io/mall/#sentiment)

-   [Text summarizing](https://mlverse.github.io/mall/#summarize)

-   [Classify text](https://mlverse.github.io/mall/#classify)

-   [Extract one, or several](https://mlverse.github.io/mall/#extract), specific pieces information from the text

-   [Translate text](https://mlverse.github.io/mall/#translate)

-   [Verify that something is true](https://mlverse.github.io/mall/#verify) about the text (binary)
