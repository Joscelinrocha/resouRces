## HTML block

Want to embed an iframe on a webpage or a slide deck? Plop the sharing code in a raw html block!

```` markdown
```{=html}
<iframe width="780" height="500" src="https://quarto.org/" title="Quarto Documentation"></iframe>
```
````

And here is the result!

```{=html}
<iframe width="780" height="500" src="https://quarto.org/" title="Quarto Documentation"></iframe>
```

A few notes on HTML blocks:

-   They're useful for visually separating out areas where you include raw HTML in an otherwise (primarily) markdown document.
-   They make it easy to programatically access those HTML blocks should you ever need to do so (e.g., with a document parser or using regular expressions).
-   If you're using the RStudio visual editor, you can insert an HTML block using **Insert \> Any \> HTML Block** or accessing the Insert Anything tool with the <kbd>⌘ /</kbd> shortcut.
