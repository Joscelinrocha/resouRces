## [Package 'brainGraph'](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brainGraph/brainGraph.pdf)

Added Sunday Dec 13th, 2020**What is this?**

**Description from site:** A set of tools for performing graph theory
analysis of brain MRI data. It works with data from a Freesurfer
analysis (cortical thickness, volumes, local gyrification index, surface
area), diffusion tensor tractography data (e.g., from FSL) and
resting-state fMRI data (e.g., from DPABI). It contains a graphical user
interface for graph visualization and data exploration, along with
several functions for generating useful figures.
