**Excerpt from site:** "This 90-minute workshop is targeted toward beginners/advanced beginners and will serve as an introduction to the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a collection of packages designed to aid in the cleaning and wrangling of data. In order to give you the tools to embark upon your own analysis on your own data, we will work through a sample data set and discuss methods for modifying, aggregating, reshaping, and visualizing data."
