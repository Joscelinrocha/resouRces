**What is this?**

**Excerpt from book:** This book is written for students at the undergraduate level with no prior knowledge of the analysis of experiments, and with no prior knowledge of computer programming.
This being said, students with no background in these areas will need to apply care and dedication in order to understand the material and the computer code used in examples.
These students may also need to explore the optional readings to obtain a better foundation in statistical thinking and theory.
