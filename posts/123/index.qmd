**Excerpt from the site:** This video series covers the basics of data wrangling using the tidyverse, aimed at my data communications class. I assume some very, very basic R background, but really not much.

This is a simplified and adapted version of my data wrangling workshops, which are available in full on my channel for tidyverse (R), data.table (R), and pandas (Python).
