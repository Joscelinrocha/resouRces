**Excerpt from the site:** The goal of this talk is to hopefully convince you that you can make your life a little bit easier by creating an internal package! An internal package is an R package, created by you, that’s just for you, to serve your work. And depending on your specific working scenario, that “you” can be substituted for you and your direct report, you and a handful of the colleagues that you closely collaborate with, or even you and your whole team.
