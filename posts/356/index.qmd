## [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)

By [Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, Jannes Muenchow](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from ebook:** This book is about using the power of computers to do things with geographic data.
It teaches a range of spatial skills, including: reading, writing and manipulating geographic data; making static and interactive maps; applying geocomputation to solve real-world problems; and modeling geographic phenomena.I added this one here because it is a nice resource to make map but it teaches way more than that :)
