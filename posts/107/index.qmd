**grateful** makes it easy to cite R and its packages in analyses by generating a BibTeX file of citations for used packages.

**Excerpt from package:** The goal of grateful is to make it very easy to cite R and the R packages used in any analyses, so that package authors receive their deserved credit. By calling a single function, grateful will scan the project for R packages used and generate a BibTeX file containing all citations for those packages.

grateful can then generate a new document with citations in the desired output format (Word, PDF, HTML, Markdown). These references can be formatted for a specific journal, so that we can just paste them directly into our manuscript or report.
