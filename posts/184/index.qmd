The estimates are arranged vertically, with a black diamond at the bottom summarizing the overall estimate. A faint background image of a historical figure in a robe is visible behind the plot."

**Excerpt from site:** Bayesian meta-analysis is uncommon, probably due to a historical lack of accessible software options for performing these tests. So in this post I'm going to outline the benefits of Bayesian meta-analysis and a step-by-step guide (with code) on to perform one using the relatively new "RoBMA" R package.
