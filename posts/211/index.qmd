## [NIRStat: Novel Statistical Methods for Studying Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) Time Series Data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NIRStat/index.html)

Added Sunday Dec 13th, 2020**What is this?**

**Description from site:** Provides transfusion-related differential
tests on Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) time series with detection
limit, which contains two testing statistics: Mean Area Under the Curve
(MAUC) and slope statistic. This package applied a penalized spline
method within imputation setting. Testing is conducted by a nested
permutation approach within imputation. Refer to Guo et al (2018)
<doi:10.1177/0962280218786302> for further details.

Cool functions from package:

1.  **MAUCtest**: MAUC statistics based Analysis for NIRS time series.
    Estimate the Mean Area Under the Curve (MAUC) statistics and conduct
    a nonparametric test on the MAUC difference before transfusion and
    after transfusion. If detection limit occurs at 15.
2.  **plotNIRS**: This function visualizes the NIRS time series data and
    estimates the underlying smoothed trend of the NRIS based on a
    nonparametric regression approach.
3.  **Slopetest**: Estimate the slope statistics and conduct a
    nonparametric based test on the slope difference before transfuion
    and after trasfusion. If detection limit occurs at 15
