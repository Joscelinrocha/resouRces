## [Modify components of a theme](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** Themes are a powerful way to customize the non-data components of your plots: i.e. titles, labels, fonts, background, gridlines, and legends.
Themes can be used to give plots a consistent customized look.
Modify a single plot's theme using theme(); see theme_update() if you want modify the active theme, to affect all subsequent plots.
Use the themes available in complete themes if you would like to use a complete theme such as theme_bw(), theme_minimal(), and more.
