**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** instead of having a legend off to the right or the bottom or wherever it is you typically place your legends, I've changed the font color of the words "Pass" and "Fail" in the title to contain this same information.
We can do this using Claus Wilke's invaluable {ggtext} package, which provides improved rendering for ggplot2.
