## [Parameterising a Multi-Part Plot](https://rfortherestofus.com/2024/06/parameterising-a-multi-part-plot) ðŸ’¯

**What is this?**

This blog post by Cara Thompson demonstrates how to create parameterized plots in R to avoid repetitive code, especially when generating multiple variants of interactive graphs.
Using the `ggplot2` package and the `palmerpenguins` dataset, the tutorial guides readers through:

1.  Setting up a custom theme and color palette.

2.  Transforming plotting code into a function that accepts arguments for flexibility.

3.  Incorporating conditional statements within the function to adjust plot elements based on input parameters.

4.  Implementing safety checks to handle potential errors and ensure consistent axis limits.

The approach emphasizes efficient coding practices, reducing redundancy, and enhancing the adaptability of plots to different datasets or groups.
