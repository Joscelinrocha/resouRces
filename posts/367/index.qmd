**What is this?**

This tutorial addresses the challenge of overplotting in maps with numerous data points.
It explores methods to visualize point density by:

-   Aggregating data within geographic boundaries.

-   Creating grids to summarize point counts.

-   Applying density gradients for smoother visual representation.

The guide provides practical examples using R packages **ggplot2** and **sf**.
