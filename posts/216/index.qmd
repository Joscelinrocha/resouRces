## [fsbrain: an R package for the visualization of structural neuroimaging data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.18.302935v1.full.pdf)

Added Sunday Dec 13th, 2020**What is this?**

**Description from site:** We introduce fsbrain, an R package for the
visualization of neuroimaging data. The package can be used to visualize
vertex-wise and region-wise morphometry data, parcellations, labels and
statistical results on brain surfaces in three dimensions (3D). Voxel
data can be displayed in lightbox mode. The fsbrain package offers
various customization options and produces publication quality plots
which can be displayed interactively, saved as bitmap images, or
integrated into R notebooks.
