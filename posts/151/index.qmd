**Excerpt from Site:** "I've set this up as an introductory resource for psychology students taking my Programming with R class at UNSW. There are two goals with this resource. The first is to provide an introduction to R programming that doesn't assume any previous experience. The second is to provide a brief sketch of some of things that R can be useful for in psychology. Data analysis inevitably forms a large part of this, but I hope to cover a broader range of topics".
