**What is this?**

Deciding if a color palette is a colorblind-friendly is a hard task.
This cannot be done in an entirely automatic fashion, as the decision needs to be confirmed by visual judgments.
The goal of colorblindcheck is to provide tools to decide if the selected color palette is colorblind-friendly.
