## [PrettyDoc Package](https://prettydoc.statr.me/)

Added Fri Oct 8th 2021

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The prettydoc package provides an alternative
engine, html_pretty, to knit your R Markdown document into pretty HTML
pages. Its usage is extremely easy: simply replace the
rmarkdown::html_document or rmarkdown::html_vignette output engine by
prettydoc::html_pretty in your R Markdown header, and use one of the
built-in themes and syntax highlighters.
