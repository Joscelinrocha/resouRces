**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** Correlations tests are arguably one of the most commonly used statistical procedures, and are used as a basis in many applications such as exploratory data analysis, structural modeling, data engineering etc. In this context, we present correlation, a toolbox for the R language(R Core Team, 2019) and part of the easy stats collection, focused on correlation analysis.
