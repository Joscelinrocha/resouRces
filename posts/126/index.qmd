**Excerpt from site:** Have you been meaning to start using R for analysis? Have you been wondering how R can make your analysis easier and your research reproducible? We present a practical introduction to R, demonstrating core analyses in psychology research (e.g., ANOVA, regression). We also explain how to manipulate and clean data in R to maintain a precise record of how the data went from raw to analysis-ready. The ideal audience for this workshop is a researcher who has not used R before, has used it briefly and then gone back to SPSS for the final analyses, or who has used R a few times but wants a better grounding in the basics.
