**Excerpt from book:** *Spatial Statistics for Data Science: Theory and Practice with R* describes statistical methods, modeling approaches, and visualization techniques to analyze spatial data using R. The book starts by providing a comprehensive overview of the types of spatial data and R packages for spatial data retrieval, manipulation, and visualization. Then, it provides a detailed explanation of the theoretical concepts of spatial statistics, along with fully reproducible examples demonstrating how to simulate, describe, and analyze areal, geostatistical, and point pattern data in various applications.
