## [Data Visualization: A practical introduction](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)

By [Kieran Healy](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This book is a hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of looking at and presenting data using R and ggplot.
R is a powerful, widely used, and freely available programming language for data analysis.
You may be interested in exploring ggplot after having used R before, or be entirely new to both R and ggplot and just want to graph your data.
I do not assume you have any prior knowledge of R.
