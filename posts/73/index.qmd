## [Adding a Sound when script is done (option 1)](https://github.com/brooke-watson/BRRR/blob/master/README.md)

**What is this?**

This is function plays a rap adlib when it is called.
It is useful if you have a script that takes a while to run, and want to be notified when it is finished.
The package currently includes 52 different sounds from 34 artists, the majority of which are pulled from The Rap Board by LP Riel.
I use it when I have long scripts to run and I want to feel amused when they are ready hahha
