## [Basic usage of tidycensus--a vignette](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from vignette:** There are two major functions implemented in tidycensus: get_decennial, which grants access to the 1990, 2000, and 2010 decennial US Census APIs, and get_acs, which grants access to the 5-year American Community Survey APIs.
