This article, part of the "Reproducible Data Science with R" series, emphasizes the importance of iteration over code duplication in R programming. It introduces the `purrr::map_*()` family of functions, which help avoid repetitive code by programmatically applying operations over data structures. The tutorial covers:

-   **Drawbacks of Code Duplication**: Highlighting errors and maintenance challenges associated with copying and pasting code.

-   **Introduction to For Loops**: Discussing basic iteration techniques in R.

-   **Mapping with `purrr`**: Demonstrating how to use `purrr`'s mapping functions for efficient and readable code.

The article provides practical examples, particularly using the `dataRetrieval` package to fetch and process water data, showcasing how iteration enhances code efficiency and reproducibility.
