**Excerpt from e-book here:** R makes it easy to work with and learn from data.

It also happens to be a programmming language, but if you're reading this, that might not be of interest. That's OK --- the goal here is not to teach programming1. The goal is to teach you just enough R to be confident to explore your data.

This book uses R like any other statistics software: To work-with and visualize data, run statistical analyses, and share our results with others. To do that you don't need more than the absolute basics of the R language itself.
