**What is this?**

**Excerpt from blog:** Handling missing values in R, one of the common tasks in data analysis is handling missing values.
In R, missing values are often represented by the symbol NA (not available) or some other value that represents missing values (i.e. 99).
Impossible values (e.g., dividing by zero) are represented by the symbol NaN (not a number)
