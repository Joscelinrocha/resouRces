## [Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/series/206)

Added Fri Apr 28th, 2023

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) is a large-scale, interdisciplinary study of how families, schools, and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent development.
It was designed to advance the understanding of the developmental pathways of both positive and negative human social behaviors.
In particular, the project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency, adult crime, substance abuse, and violence.
At the same time, the project also provided a detailed look at the environments in which these social behaviors take place by collecting substantial amounts of data about urban Chicago, including its people, institutions, and resources.
