## [Research Methods in Practice 1](https://benwhalley.github.io/rmip/)

By [Ben Whalley, Ellie Lloyd, Maggie Brennan, and Andy Wills](https://benwhalley.github.io/rmip/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from ebook:** We cover qualitative approaches, where you search for common themes within spoken or written material, and quantitative approaches where you use one or more measures to predict an outcome.
Each week you will work in groups to solve problems and work towards a practical presentation of your work at the end of the semester (worth 20% of the mark), with two pieces of written coursework during the module (80% of the mark).
