**What is this?**

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide on creating diamond plots in R, a visualization technique that emphasizes confidence intervals over point estimates.
Diamond plots are particularly useful in meta-analyses and comparative studies, as they focus on the precision of estimates rather than just the estimates themselves.
The guide walks through the process of constructing diamond plots using the **ufs** package, detailing functions like `meansDiamondPlot()` and `diamondPlot()`.
It includes practical examples and code snippets, making it accessible for users aiming to enhance their data visualization skills in R.
