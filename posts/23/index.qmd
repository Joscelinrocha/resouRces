In this article, David Keyes shares his standardized approach to organizing RStudio projects to enhance efficiency and collaboration. He emphasizes the importance of a consistent file structure, detailing the use of specific folders such as `data-raw` for raw data, `data` for processed data, and `R` for functions. By adopting this structure, Keyes reduces decision fatigue and streamlines project workflows, making it easier for both individual and collaborative work.
