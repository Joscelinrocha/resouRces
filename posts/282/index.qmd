## [Model Summary](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/)

**What is this?**

modelsummary creates beautiful and customizable tables to summarize statistical models in R.
Results from several models are presented side-by-side.
Tables can be echoed to the R console or viewed in the RStudio Viewer.
They can be saved to HTML, PDF, Text/Markdown, LaTeX, MS Word, RTF, JPG, and PNG formats.
Tables can easily be embedded in dynamic document pipelines like Rmarkdown, knitr, or Sweave.
