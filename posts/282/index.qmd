**Excerpt from site:** modelsummary creates beautiful and customizable tables to summarize statistical models in R. Results from several models are presented side-by-side. Tables can be echoed to the R console or viewed in the RStudio Viewer. They can be saved to HTML, PDF, Text/Markdown, LaTeX, MS Word, RTF, JPG, and PNG formats. Tables can easily be embedded in dynamic document pipelines like Rmarkdown, knitr, or Sweave.
