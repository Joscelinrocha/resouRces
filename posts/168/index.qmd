## [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://rstats.wtf/index.html) ðŸŒ³

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The initial impetus for creating these materials is a two-day hands-on workshop. The in-person workshops are still the primary delivery method for this content, but we've begun recording prose versions of this content, in order to make it more widely available and for participants to refer back to. Warning: these materials absolutely do not constitute a self-contained "book", nor do they capture all workshop content.
