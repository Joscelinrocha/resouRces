**Excerpt from tutorial here:**

-   **Goal:** Discuss two methods to detect reliability (of cognitive tasks in this case) using Bayesian hierarchical linear models (HLMs) in `brms`.

-   **Case Study:** The Dot-Probe Task. Contrary to a recent publication that claims the emotional dot-probe task is not a reliable measure, I’ll show that more nuanced modeling suggests the task is probably “fine” reliability-wise.

-   **The Bottom Line:** This tutorial-like post demonstrates how Bayesian HLM can fundamentally change reliability assessment. By analyzing trial-level data rather than aggregated scores, these methods can uncover meaningful signal where traditional approaches see only noise—potentially rehabilitating numerous tasks previously deemed psychometrically inadequate.
