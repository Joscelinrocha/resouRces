**Description from site:** Neuroconductor is an open-source platform for rapid testing and dissemination of reproducible computational imaging software. The goals of the project are to:

provide a centralized repository of R software dedicated to image analysis; disseminate quickly software updates; educate a large, diverse community of scientists using detailed tutorials and short courses; ensure quality via automatic and manual quality controls; and promote reproducibility of image data analysis. Based on the programming language R, Neuroconductor started with 51 inter-operable packages that cover multiple areas of imaging including visualization, data processing and storage, and statistical inference. Neuroconductor accepts new R package submissions, which are subject to a formal review and continuous automated testing.
