**Description from site:** Neuroconductor is an open-source platform for
rapid testing and dissemination of reproducible computational imaging
software. The goals of the project are to:

provide a centralized repository of R software dedicated to image
analysis; disseminate quickly software updates; educate a large, diverse
community of scientists using detailed tutorials and short courses;
ensure quality via automatic and manual quality controls; and promote
reproducibility of image data analysis. Based on the programming
language R, Neuroconductor started with 51 inter-operable packages that
cover multiple areas of imaging including visualization, data processing
and storage, and statistical inference. Neuroconductor accepts new R
package submissions, which are subject to a formal review and continuous
automated testing.
