## [Reproducible Data Workflows With Drake by Garrick Aden-Buie](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/talk/drake-intro-biodataclub/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from blog:** drake is an R package that provides a powerful, flexible workflow management tool for reproducible data analysis pipelines. drake alleviates the pain of managing large (and even small) data analyses, speeding up iteration and development while providing reproducibility guarantees that are essential for modern research.

In this session, we'll learn how to use drake to manage a data analysis workflow by writing functions that define the steps of the analysis. We'll then learn how drake can keep track of all of these steps, from start to finish, and intelligently update only the outdated steps when your data or code change.
