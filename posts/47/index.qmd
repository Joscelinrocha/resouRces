**Excerpt from site here:** The mission of Papers with Code is to create a free and open resource with Machine Learning papers, code, and evaluation tables. We believe this is best done together with the community, supported by NLP and ML. All content on this website is openly licenced under CC-BY-SA (same as Wikipedia) and everyone can contribute - look for the "Edit" buttons! We also operate specialized portals for papers with code in astronomy, physics, computer sciences, mathematics and statistics.
