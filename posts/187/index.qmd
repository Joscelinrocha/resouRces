## [Workshop: A Practical Guide for Meta-Analyses in R](https://constantinyvesplessen.com/post/workshop_meta_analysis/)

By [Constantin Yves
Plessen](https://constantinyvesplessen.com/post/workshop_meta_analysis/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This blogpost is an adaption from my 90 minute
workshop on all basic steps in conducting a meta-analysis in R. The
audience of the original workshop were graduate psychology students at
the University of Vienna with a focus on research methods. Most
statistical and methodical elements were already discussed, yet the
implementation in R was new to all of them. And programming in general
was new to most of them. I therefore introduced R very shortly, before
explaining the actual meta-analytical analyses more briefly. I added
some explanations and references to make the file more self-explanatory
for independent study. Therefore, this post also contains materials and
references on how to install R, R Studio, and some basic concepts of
programming.
