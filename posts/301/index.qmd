## [Statistical Rethinking 2 with Stan and R](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/rethinking2/)

By [Vincent Arel-Bundock](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/rethinking2/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book:** Vincent is trying to replicate (nearly) all the models in Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking (2nd ed.) book using Stan, R, rstan, tidybayes, and ggplot2.
This is work in progress.
