## [geomtextpath by Allan Cameron](https://github.com/AllanCameron/geomtextpath)  
Added Sat Dec 11th, 2021     
**What is this?**      
Excerpt from site: "The existing text-based geom layers in ggplot2 (geom_text and geom_label) are ideal for the majority of plots, since typically textual annotations are short, straight and in line with the axes of the plot. However, there are some occasions when it is useful to have text follow a curved path. This may be to create or recreate a specific visual effect, or it may be to label a circular / polar plot in a more “natural” way."

**What is this?**
Excerpt from blog: Choosing good colors for your charts is hard. This article tries to make it easier.

I want you to feel more confident in your color choices. And if you have no sense for colors at all, here’s my attempt to help you find good ones anyway. We’ll talk about common color mistakes I see out there in the wild, and how to avoid them.

This is not the right article for you if you’re trying to find good gradients or shades. But if you need to find beautiful, distinctive colors for different categories (e.g. continents, industries, bird species) for your line charts, pie charts, stacked bar charts, etc., read on.

## [The grobblR package to make graph for PDF docs](https://github.com/calvinmfloyd/grobblR)
**What is this?**
Excerpt from readm.me: The grobblR package allows R users the ability to intuitively create flexible, reproducible PDF reports comprised of aesthetically pleasing tables, images, plots and/or text. This is done by implementing grobs from the grid and gridExtra packages.

## [The R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/)      
*Added Sep 14th, 2020*       
**What is this?**      
R graph gallery, a collection of charts made with the R programming language. Hundreds of charts are displayed in several sections, always with their reproducible code available. The gallery makes a focus on the tidyverse and ggplot2. Feel free to suggest a chart or report a bug; any feedback is highly welcome.

## [TidyX YouTube channel hosted by Ellis Hughes & Patrick Ward](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP8l94xtoemCH_GxByvTuFQ/featured)
**What is this?**       
Excerpt from channel: TidyX is a screen cast where we select a person’s code from the TidyTuesday project and go through their code line-by-line, explaining what they did and how the functions they used work. We also break down the visualizations they create and talk about how to apply similar approaches to other data sets. The objective is to help more people learn R and get involved in the TidyTuesday community.
