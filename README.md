# Learning-R-Resources

Since I got introduced to R, I have been accumulating resources that could help me and others in this process. In the past two years, I have taken the role of teaching R to people in my lab and university. Last semester I, for the first time, opened my class to people outside of the school. It was an incredible experience, and I would like to continue doing it.

I used to keep track of these sources in a private Trello, but honestly, why should I just keep it to myself? I hope it helps you all!

# FAQs
**How do I keep up to date with any changes?**   
Please note that this is a work in progress, I add resources every week or as often as I find resources.

Remember to check back in regularly to get any updates. Or, you can watch or ⭐ star the repo to get notified automatically for any changes or new additions.

**I've spotted a mistake or would like to contribute**   
Please open a new issue. Better yet, please fork the repo and submit an upstream pull request. I'm very grateful for any contributions, but may be slow to respond (trying to get a doctorate done). I try my best to assign the resources in the categories I have listed but sometimes they are ambiguous. If I have time I put them in both categories but I usually don't. If you think something really doesn't belong in a certain category or the information is wrong such as authors names, summaries, or even links, just open an issue.

**Why are you doing this?**    
I struggled a lot getting resources to learn how to code. I started with python which I love but it wasn't until I found the R community that I felt welcomed. I really admire all the people that make these resources available for anyone to learn and teach this language. I used to collect all the available resources and bookmarked them or emailed them to myself but I figure hundred of people do this as well so just wanted to help.

**What can you do to thank me?**     
This is a weird thing that someone asked me. I just would really appreciate it if you share it with your peers and especially BIPOC young people who otherwise cannot afford expensive courses to learn this skill.
