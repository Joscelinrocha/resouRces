## [Workshop: A Practical Guide for Meta-Analyses in R by Constantin Yves Plessen](https://constantinyvesplessen.com/post/workshop_meta_analysis/)
**What is this?**

Excerpt from site:
This blogpost is an adaption from my 90 minute workshop on all basic steps in conducting a meta-analysis in R.
The audience of the original workshop were graduate psychology students at the University of Vienna with a focus on research methods. Most statistical and methodical elements were already discussed, yet the implementation in R was new to all of them. And programming in general was new to most of them. I therefore introduced R very shortly, before explaining the actual meta-analytical analyses more briefly. I added some explanations and references to make the file more self-explanatory for independent study. Therefore, this post also contains materials and references on how to install R, R Studio, and some basic concepts of programming.
