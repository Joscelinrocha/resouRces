## [Conversion in Psychology-MsC course](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-conv-f2f/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This book contains the quantitative research methods materials for students on the MSc Conversion in Psychological Studies/Science.
The students are typically a diverse cohort and range from those with no STEM or programming background to engineering and computing science graduates.
Compared to the undergraduate degree, the students are older, and there is a greater incidence of computer anxiety.

The focus for the MSc is to provide a basic but solid competency in core data skills and statistics that can be built on in further study.
Students who wish to push themselves beyond the core competencies are encouraged to consult the MSc Data Skills course where they can learn about e.g., simulation and custom functions.
To support those students who may have very limited computer literacy, the beginning stages are more supported than in the undergraduate programme e.g., with an increased use of screenshots and explanations for terminology.

## [Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century](https://statsthinking21.org/) ðŸ’¯

By [Russell Poldrack](https://statsthinking21.org/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The goal of this book is to the tell the story of statistics as it is used today by researchers around the world.
It's a different story than the one told in most introductory statistics books, which focus on teaching how to use a set of tools to acheive very specific goals.
This book focuses on understanding the basic ideas of statistical thinking --- a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and make decisions and predictions, all in the context of the inherent uncertainty that exists in the real world.
It also brings to bear current methods that have only become feasible in light of the amazing increases in computational power that have happened in the last few decades.
Analyses that would have taken years in the 1950's can now be completed in a few seconds on a standard laptop computer, and this power unleashes the ability to use computer simulation to ask questions in new and powerful ways.

# Power Analysis

This section has all resources I encounter to run power analysis regardless of them using R or not.

## [**powerLATE**](https://github.com/kbansak/powerLATE):

**Excerpt from site:** powerLATE implements the generalized power analysis for the local average treatment effect (LATE), proposed by Bansak (2020).

Power analysis is in the context of estimating the LATE (also known as the complier average causal effect, or CACE), with calculations based on a test of the null hypothesis that the LATE equals 0 with a two-sided alternative.
The method uses standardized effect sizes to place a conservative bound on the power under minimal assumptions.
powerLATE allows users to recover power, sample size requirements, or minimum detectable effect sizes.
It also allows users to work with absolute effects rather than effect sizes, to specify an additional assumption to narrow the bounds, and to incorporate covariate adjustment.

## [**Simulation for Power Analysis**](https://nickch-k.github.io/EconometricsSlides/Week_08/Power_Simulations.html)

By [**Nick Huntington-Klein**](https://nickch-k.github.io/EconometricsSlides/Week_08/Power_Simulations.html)

**Excerpt from site:** In this document we'll talk about power analysis in general and how it's done, and then we'll go into how to perform a power analysis using simulation in R, making use of tools from the tidyverse.
