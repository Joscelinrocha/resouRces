title: "resouRces: Database for resources to help you learn and teach R"
---

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Since I got introduced to R, I have been accumulating resources that could help me and others in this process. In the past two years, I have taken the role of teaching R to people in my lab and university. Last semester I, for the first time, opened my class to people outside of the school. It was an incredible experience, and I would like to continue doing it.

I used to keep track of these sources in a private Trello, but honestly, why should I just keep it to myself? I hope it helps you all!

Since I got introduced to R in 2016, I have been accumulating resources that could help me and others in this process. In the past 5 years, I have taken the role of teaching R to people in my lab and university. This database was originally shared as github wiki but finally this 2023, I was able to create an official website for all of you and to make it easier for others to contribute.

Hope you find this useful and feel free to share it with anyone 😊 !

Best,

Joscelin
