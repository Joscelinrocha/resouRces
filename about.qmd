[**Dr. Joscelin Rocha-Hidalgo**](http://www.joscelinrocha.com/) (she/her/hers) is a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Psychology Department at Penn State University.

Joscelin's overall research centers around factors that impact children's cognitive development during infancy and early childhood. Specifically, she examines the foundational systems of human cognition (e.g., working memory, attention, and word learning), the way contextual influences (e.g., parent-child interactions, bilingual exposure) support (or hinder) cognitive skills, and the development of cognitive skills across time in infants and toddlers.

Research methods include: electroencephalography (EEG), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), eye tracking, behavior, and electrocardiogram (ECG)

Joscelin is also an avid social justice, environmental, and open-science advocate. She created this database to help others who are in the journey of learning R and teaching it.\
